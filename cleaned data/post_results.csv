1nudrkt,darkbluedarz,2025-09-30 13:51:15+00:00,895,Negative,0.8732342720031738,i am furious i emailed riot a week ago explaining that we have a china expat community that ran into issues buying tickets for msi and previous lol events no reply tickets for the semifinals finals went on presale this morning for only those who have a mastercard http and theyre gone http our group has tried all morning for an hour straight to get a ticket and they got botted and are already on reselling sites at x price riot will say its linked to your passport which does not matter in china they dont care at the door of the event if youre thinking about flying to shanghai for the event dont bother as an international visitor you wont get a ticket shameful from riot
