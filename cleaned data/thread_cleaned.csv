takes the fun out of it too u cant actually just think with ur head for a second u need a graph to tell you what may happen bruhhh its bad in other sports its especially bad in league but if amazon wants to pay to keep the lights on at worlds in exchange for a silly stat being shown twice a game im all for it lpl has added ai win probabilities in chinese streams since around years ago personally i feel that prediction is much more conservative while more reasonable compared to the win probabilities in official streams i dont know whether it is because riot just added the ai prediction recently and havnt trained it with enough data win probability gold kills combined whoever programmed that is so lazy lol its clearly not got enough data behind it completly agree that shit is garbage like g win at min come on we saw there is a lot of things that can happen even min before the end they were predicted blg wins deleted someone linked their dev blog http wp has an intuitive meaning wp for team x is easy to understand without added context k gd requires additional context to gauge sic its impact see below wp doesnt change based on the game time wp at minutes has the same meaning as wp at minutes k gd at minutes and k gd at minutes have different impacts only those with deep lol knowledge can correctly interpret that impact this part i dont like obligatory snarky its not its but also most league players even without deep knowledge knows what gold diff at a given time means although i do think watching a game without seeing gold diff and guessing the gold diff is a real skill but yeah its not hard to interpret k gd at vs whereas its really really hard to interpret their win percentage metric because all it tells you is the black box thinks a team has a chance to win you have to guess why it thinks that on the other hand i do like the idea of trying to figure out which events in game affect winning chances since especially before the dragon nerfs but even still dragons feel undervalued to me by many players who are ok giving it up or trading for herald when to me that usually feels losing when they write to take this a step further we could potentially explore win probability added wpa that sounds like theyre on the right track but its weird to me that they say wp models arent meant to predict which team will win at any given point in time wp is meant to reflect the relative changes in gamestate based on previous performances how can it reflect changes if it doesnt predict accurately you cant tell the impact a certain event has if the win prediction isnt accurate im curious if its more or less accurate than some simple linear model using only a few important factors out of their list particularly goldxpdragons edit this would be interesting to check and much easier to check if they also released the gold dragons inhibs etc that they use that would dispose me much more favorably towards aws than just providing their win percent but idk if they released those anywhere or not its so ridiculous that sometimes win probability reaches and then it goes down again like then its not really is it team gets a few kills graph win probability ah i see many people here dont understand how odds like this works to begin with just because the odds lean one way doesnt mean it will happen it means if you did that exact same thing to that point times then that outcome should happen that percentage of times but we arent doing it a million times we do it once so the odds are whats likely to happen not what will happen the win probably is just a stat they can sell to their sponsors it has never meant anything i think in its current form it doesnt add anything most viewers already know a team is in a winning position when they have sould massive gold lead etc the graph showing that doesnt provide any additional information however the idea itself isnt completely bad but they would have to implement it differently lets say minutes in both teams are even in goldkillsdrakes etc but one team has an early game comp while the other has a late game comp obviously the game state is even and by the metrics used this would be a win probability for each team but anyone who knows about the game would tell you the scaling late game comp is massively favoured to win the game from this gamestate if they were able to somehow show how much of an advantage the scaling comp has based on how good they scale etc then it would be a good addition that would actually add something to the viewer experience but as it is it doesnt really add anything dotaplus is much better jesus people really find anything to complain about huh calling it useless is nonsensical wed just be back to using gold diff which is even worse i find it truly hilarious that the comments are mad that its inaccurate while simultaneously being mad that its sppoiling insane irony the more accurate it becomes the less interesting the game is inherently its just a method to give less enfranchised viewers a better idea of who is in the lead and give the casters a platform to communicate the why to the audience if their chance of winning has been for seven minutes why the fuck am i still watching this game meanwhile if i want to see which adc is ahead i gotta wait until the observers randomly show the gold of all champions then find and subtract the corresponding values aint this the best alternative though i see a lot of comments bashing them previously when ads were intrusive or explicitly stated this is probably the best compromise where yes it appears a lot but its also something you could just not pay attention to and it doesnt significantly affect your viewing experience if it was accurate it would be even worse gambling is steadily creeping into pro lol as well i physically cringe whenever nba debate shows talk about odds and they talk about them every show its completelly embedded into the system at this point its so sad i do want to see the win probability the aws shit beforehand makes me think they dont care that its useless because that sponsorship is making rito i like it just for the meme potential it actually is if you wanna have an idea on whos winning and not just look the the gold difference graph its basically the same thing well its only there so riot can take some money from sponsors but they could think about something better you can say the same for every sport no i also watch tennis and the win probability doesnt provide much insught too i just choose to ignore it salty eu fan i think they just need to change the name of the win probability stat and it would be fine change it to something like team advantage it communicates which team currently has the advantage in terms of towersgold but doesnt imply that if i flipped a coin a certain team would just win by default if i put a rated player against magnus carlsen and gave the rated player an extra knight nobody would have qualms with saying a chess engine saying the rated player has a advantage in that position people would take issue with a chess engine saying the rated player has a chance of winning when i look at a chess engine and it says i know it means that white has the advantage but it doesnt mean white has a chance of winning i think the win probability stat is supposed to communicate something similar but the name throws people off dotas prediction actually uses ai and looking at previous gamestates to determine who is more likely to win lol is just adding up gold and levels lmao why do esports fans have an allergic reaction to sponsors if the game has no sponsors then the scene would look a lot worse exactly its terrrible every game it flip flops blue team to red back to blue etc useless its really not that bad man lol the crux of the argument is that even if it was good or gets better it spoils part of the fun and excitement its only a negative experience i would say that if it was accurate with really interesting parameters theres a case for selling it to teams for analyst reasons but with so many factors even outside the game it would require more upkeep than its ever going to sell for lol all the ehehe you silly redditors i have a phd in data science and snort you obviously dont understand how these statistics work i am literally le cringing in my boots right now from these comments no one fucking cares just because the percentage is an evaluation based on likelihood from past results which is how weather predictions work ops point is still valid its a lazy way to check off a partnership incorporation into the stream and even if youre a new viewer who is for some reason going to try to rely on that graph to understand whos leading youre much better off just listening to the cast and getting their take yeah its literally just sponsorship but like you said it doesnt really add anything other than a talking point for the casters which they dont really need i hard disagree let me explain for someone new or badinexperienced at lol this is the best thing added to the esports what is the difference between k lead at min vs min someone experience will know but not a newcomer now add the dragons the soul the turrets where the gold is and so on it may be a lot to process i will always remember when i got into lol i was watching games with kills against and then the team would lose most of the times to koreans and i would not understand i always thought we were winning hard but the koreans played differently they did lane swap to get earlier turrets for instance and thus would get way more gold and map control and i would not understand the significance sure the win probability is far from perfect and accurate but it makes league of legends esports way easier to follow yeah its bad yea but its sponsorship so your complaint adds nothing as well you making a post about it is exactly what amazon wants and therefore increasing the chance of seeing it again every aws ad in every sport ever is the same its pure unadulterated bullshit guesswork that shows nothing and predicts less i chuckled everytime win probability has been shown show me the actual gold graph thanks or another graph with usefull data then ill make my own win probability are there any games where the prediction chart was different then the gold dif chart have it but dont make it continuous broadcast the pointwise prediction at mins based on all data collected between in the preceding mins and make it like an event the audience can wait for then the casters and desk can comment on the successful or failed prediction making it continuous just makes it seem like an extra gold difference tracker its boring af i wonder how did the algorithm work like what kind of model is constructed in the background i took data analytics courses and we have a course that specializes in sports analytics my prof brought up data collection method for hokey player and mention that most analytics came out days or weeks after so i asked if its possible that perhaps some teams may have some sort bleeding edge tech to do analytic in real time which may give them a massive advantage for midmatch decision making the answer was no at least to his knowledge he is certain however that upscale firm offer post night analysis as you have a match this evening and the data analysis will be up by next morning for professional teams during major event this is already extremely fast and apparently comes with big pay check lesser team usually waits weeks if not more for their analysis result now since league of legend is a video game so data collection should be a lot easier but considering how much money traditional sports are collectively investing in data science and they still couldnt manage to have a affordable approach to precise real time analysis i very much doubt aws have some giga secret tech that allows them to give good real time prediction now it is pretty terrible as many of yall already said but still i wonder exactly whats going on behind the graph i dont know how the ai is written but id argue predicting win probability is just as much about champions and item spikes as it is about gold turrets and dragons it would take a lot of design work to make a good algorythm predict win probablity well i understand that its a sponsorship fulfillment i mean u can just end the post here idk why we gotta complain since we clearly arent spending the money to keep pro lol afloat every sport does this its to add to the drama when a team gets upset you can literally just ignore it op im sorry but you really have a fundamental misunderstanding of ml and statistics what do you mean it literally cant work is it because youre saying its only considering a small subset of features to make its prediction because newsflash thats what the whole field of stats is lmfao it is insanely accurate you might believe the system is flawed when it displayed of win for red side and eventually blue side wins but thats just how probabilities work of the time blue can still reverse it in similar situations the algorithm they use is named xgboost and it can learn on extremely complex data they wrote a blog post about it and it has so many variables at hand that from my own experience with the same machine learning method it must work however it may spoil the result thats not fun its literally an advertisement for aws relax weirdest post ever also there is an absurd amount of replays and we lose important info i think they are literally adding and changing stuff just so they can say here is a new thingchange that we did guys classec aws giving information about how many cm people were driving from a wall at some point because none of their other stats actually added anything but they want any reason to make them seem like the stats company the fact that it starts out at just shows how completely useless it is for example fncs winrate chance at the start of the game was closer to as soon as trymbi picked alistar into caitlyn lux maybe even less i dont use league rd part software anymore because the stats they givedo not matter timers are nice but the constant influx of builds with the best winrate and counters are all completely nonsense play how you want to play bro they think they are oracle from epl bad take lmao that looks like a stupid mimicry of the win probability given by ai in chess games so you hate it because its useless but would also hate it if it werent useless great take holy sht someone is mad over stats lol they are just stating a fact they have no malice towards you this is how percentages work i dont understand being so bothered by it the amount of people in this thread that dont get how data works is astounding my biggest concern about that it was he could spoil results but it doesnt it only seems to change based on who has more gold certainly that cant predict throws from the times i paid attention only in that set of blg vs g when g was behind in k gold it still predicted a high percent g could win according to a riot article they made about how that works barely read it only the part where it said they used the data from matches since years ago from riots on blog wp models arent meant to predict which team will win at any given point in time wp is meant to reflect the relative changes in gamestate based on previous performances im ngl i really like it people are complaining about how its wrong all the time but the graphs where its chance one team wins and then flips completely to the other side after so choke or play is exactly what makes it so funny i especially love this in basketball or football last play of the game dont kneel or something throw a pick six lol yea theres no upside for a viewer at least we need a stat for used gold vs un used gold its very silly but its also quite obvious that riot is hurting for sponsor dollars so that explains it xb i think the fact that its so wildly useless is more amusing than anything team a is on comfort picks with dragon soul and baron buff but gold is even so the game is it fulfills the roll of bezos giving money to rito i heckin loved forced ad reads it really adds to my worlds experience everytime the cast stops dead in its tracks to talk abt the line on the bottom of the screen or a replay after every fucking kill like some replays are so pointless oh wow an ezreal ult while they were backing lets watch it in slow motion times out of like gambling odds lol pretty sure its for certain people take a shot whenever the ai predicts it wrong makes this feature a lot more fun theyre prepping things for gambling its for betting literally only thing i hope for is it to have practically win rate just for that team to lose it also seems extremely biased too one of the games today had a win rate or something for the lpl team even though they were losing in all aspects but they made a macro play to get some gold back i stand by not ever wanting to see it again its like expected goals in football expected goals for team x continues scoring wtf is this trash lol my favorite by far is when they call it the heart rate monitor cuz its going from win rate blue team to win rate red team back to win rate blue team then red team wins the game yeah fuck this shit can we ping some riot staff here win probability is the thing that makes game betting exist its not there to try to actually predict the winner its there to measure leadsgame states and contextualize potential comebacks it gives you an idea of how significant a lead is and thus how unlikely a comeback is from that given point if youre just looking at whether it was right or wrong youre misinterpreting its purpose edit only talking the theory behind it whether its actually well calculated for this purpose is a whole other question though this and the stupid damage in teamfight box as well in game of dk vs kt viego goes to botside tribrush to find the neeko and the box literally blocks the entire interaction then we cant even see viego for like seconds and the box just makes it so the camera has to zoom out further in order to see the fight shouldnt have all this clutter on screen i dont want shittyass sponsoring names on stuff horrible beverage baron and credit card gold diff are just two of the more annoying ones imagine if they added this in solo queue people in this comments section outing themselves for not understanding the stat showing win probability simply means paving the path for betting officially all this fucking sponsorship ruins the broadcast isnt the win probability just telling viewers that given the lead one team has over the other what the chance of victory is i get it is a spoiler but in a game like lol some games are just won and known to have been won way before the game is over at the same time it also can provide excitement because if a team makes a comeback then despite a win probability saying of victory they do it anyway or make it take into account team comps or scaling or objectives or anything other than team has more golder is betterer also gatekeeping generated gold behind a sponsored thing is really annoying as well why do i have to wait minutes to see just how badly bb got slammed by bin and its not even updating throughout the course of the picture being shown while stuff like turrets being taken is happening useless red bull baron powerplay my smartass where wings when you have baron buff i feel for the casters at least with the economy and other graphics there is something to talk about the prediction is justthere like what are you supposed to say about it it offers nothing but if aws wants to fund these events im not gonna moan too much about it and even if it did work even though it literally cant one stat to trigger them all this thread and all the comments are hilarious youre going to keep seeing it because they choose to display it if its a meaningless stat display that doesnt actually indicate anything then what do you care oh no extra numbers on your screen boo hoo this sub is pretty pathetic it doesnt bother me its a nice graph in my opinion they said that most of the fans wanted this back so now its not fun anymore how does win probability spoil the result does showing each teams networth also spoil the result does it really ruin your viewing experience that much as a league fan im just glad riot has nonendemic sponsors makes league look more legitimate and even if it did work even though it literally cant i wouldnt want it because it would just be spoiling the result or minutes in op are you sure you understand how probabilities work consider viewers who havent played league for a long time i think its a harmless stat which can help those who dont play the game get a good idea of the state of the match over time bruh i said that days ago and got downvoted to oblivion love reddit lmao i think it would be better used as an aftergame graph they can show instead of during the game at least i would welcome it a lot more if i can use it for my confirmation bias after instead of flaming it as it shows up ingame it literally doesnt bother me at all im partially satisfied when its wrong sometimes its basically well known that you can predict most professional games with accuracy at minutes there are some published papers that say at champ select in solo queue but im convinced those are the result of data poisoning i think is more likely last time i checked which was a couple of years ago was probably sota among the people trying to do it i think what it does most of all is spoil how fixed the result of a league game is at minutes or so like no one wants to hear it but by minutes in pro or solo queue the game is pretty much decided its literally who had more gold ppl want to see whois favored the more hardcore fans prob not since they already have an idea but people in general like to know a little info about the teamsmatchups are you saying its very inaccurate thought i saw some riot page showing the data they use and it seemed extensive although i didnt really read any of it or are you saying its so inaccurate that its misleading and that picking against it is very accurate sorta confused on your beef i mean you can just pay it no mind theres a reason why win probability is featured in almost any competition even if its not data backed and just a panel of people choosing people just want to know imagine if at any point mid game you as the viewer could submit your win probability or maybe mid game at certain points they open a poll where everyone votes of course there are trolls but record every vote by every player and you can form a score for how reliable or knowledgeable a voter is naturally casters pro players and costreamers are going to end up getting higher reliability scores so their votes count more we all have a sense of the probability by looking at the players champions kill breakdown objectives and lane states after a few tournaments you have enough data to train a neural net on aws to get a legit win probability include a link to a machine learning blog on aws where people can debate how to make this stat more accurate sounds like a lot more traffic through aws not to mention you have kind of outsourced the machine learning development and idea generation to the player base its basically just gold differencedragons a stat that pops onto the screen for a few seconds bothers you that much really thats how sensitive we are in its meant for the general audience or casual viewers to get a better understanding of whos winning or losing beyond just kills of course its not going to taking into account a million factors just liked seeing kt beat dk while behind in kills dragons but still close in gold if you donate a mil or so they d also show stuff that you wanna show did they say it was ai powered yet or no the win probability stat isnt meant for people on this subreddit its meant for newer players who dont know everything thats going on if youre on this subreddit making posts and commenting chances are you are much more aware than the average fan i personally dont mind it doesnt take away from anything and allows for the tournament to get more sponsors jatt be like but the win rate tho it bothers me theyre using a computationally expensive algorithm to tell us exactly what the gold and objective huds are already saying every sport has this its one of those things you just have to get used to all it does is take a snapshot of current gold or objective lead and assumes nothing changes i assume the data the model is trained on is too wide like an average of the community instead it should be more targeted to that specific team and how they do given a lead and vs whom etc like g vs blg it predicts g winning with a small lead even though we all know this is far from truth its not about you its all about gambling i see two different problems it doesnt take into consideration that things that happen early in the game have greater variance and less impact later on a k gold lead at minutes is significant but itll then extrapolate that to the team in the lead contiuning that streak into a minute win it needs to learn that only in very specific situations is there a winrate and that they need to give like leeway for teams making mistakes in most situations a certain win as the ai currently sees it should be around instead of it showing it should only see when one side wiped the other in a lategame scenario and just has to run it down mid and auto the nexus to win i dont get why aws even waste money on this like does aws even need advertising me and my partner were laughing about exactly this last night every team fight the win probability comes up and we are omg no way they won the teamfight and so now theyre win chance thats amazing oh no they lost a fight now the other team is win chance it just doesnt tell you anything that isnt clearlyvisible from the game state gold difference graph is interesting and shows big swings in the game or large dominance goldcomparison between roles is interesting and wish they showed that more the level graph is okay its poorly presented imo there could just be some guy turning a lever a bit more towards one team or another based on feeling and it would be about as accurate and helpful as always people have a shit understanding of statistics isnt it just a gold graph too lmao if it is an ai that makes it both interesting and even more sad than i thought because its really wrong a lot of the time too lmaoo it values gold way too high in later games and seems to not factor champ scaling hardly at sll well lets just have a look at the red bull baron power play about that are you questioning that teams with a k lead at mins have a winrate to make a serviceable not good one you would need a ton of intangibles added what are the team comp differences how much of a lead does team a need to have to be winning can this team actually end the game without a dream fight to make it better you need even more what builds is everyone going how close are people to their power spikes even more how does each champion function into this team comp an extreme example would be a master yi into an army of cc or an adc that has no good peel into a team that entirely outranges or can engage from out of range usually pro comps arent that skewed but in almost every game one person is set up to have a bad time i think overall this task is too hard and theres a billion things that you could never get quite right none of it even takes in to account who the player is and how theyre performing that day you might be up k gold but youre playing against faker your win probability is much lower than normal perfection is the enemy of good here but good is also unattainable so its just annoying i dont mind it since it keeps the lights on but boy they should really find something better to sponsor its as if riot wanted to promote betting on the matches big agree its so stupid because it predicts based on what should happen but in league of legends that is almost never what does happen it is only meaningful in handless metas and even then its still cringe i just want a live view during replays because the replay timing has been terible they showed win probability a few times during ti finals its the kinda sponsored content that makes you feel attraction to the brand

cap though i just hope lucid gets a chance geng main youtube channel just disabled the comments on their most recent video so their fans are basically roasting them on every other video lol the entire korean scene will be shuffled around this year its crazy the tricky part will be jungle peanut is their macro but from that point on you may have to take the risk regional titles are all well and good but what these top teams want are international titles quick note here i dont expect doran to be reading the lol sub or anything but do try to be kind ive been interviewing for a few years now and ive never seen anyone as crushed as doran was after the loss however disappointed you may be in geng bear in mind hes probably feeling that x he was in rough shape and im surprised he took the interview at all mad respect that he decided to talk to me despite the way things ended man doran you just absolutely have to flash that jarvan ult there heartbreaking geng morgan im ready people flame doran a lot but this guy is really good and unless theyre getting one of zeuskiin it is a downgrade just in terms of individual skill heartbreaker for gen g after the threepeat too its for the best though honestly feels like an old tsmg situation where they roll their region but lay an egg at worlds changes must be made something must change botlane should remained untouched peyz is in his rookie year and exceeded expectations all year long delight looked like the best lck support chovy should stay the thing with him is that yes he choked previously but sometimes it feels like he cant do more when topjg are inting like we saw today peanut owns lck and at worlds we all know what happens flash over the wall took his career lol is it weird that it actually makes me emotional ive been supporting geng since and weve had lots of changes since then obviously but this roster had so much heart and we literally dominated the lck i knew it would happen but it just hurts still this geng is just t all over again domestic beasts but no where close to that internationally as a casual fan it really looks like geng didnt warm up before the games this is expected since they only played like games to get here i wonder if geng would have performed better if they didnt and only played four stage games then again this is not an excuse unless jdg also chokes tomorrow cause a superteam should not be choking even if there isnt enough practice peanut and doran should really be the ones under scrutiny chovy may have underperformed but the spotlight shone too brightly on peanut and doran i want a dream team of doran oner chovy teddy kellin for kr mad tigers peanut will probably go or even chovy ok here me out chovy and viper to dk along with canyon and showmaker ive always thought that chovys playstyle suits him more if hes a top laner he can be the next xiahou and dominate in that lane that would be a dream team tbh dont care about support just a good shotcaller have a cooked too much lil bro still thinks he will be on the team it hasnt even been hours since elimination and already these orgs talk about roster changes it must be demoralizing for the players do you know which guy will be leaving the team of course i know him hes me geng are a great team but i think at this point we have to say they just dont have the clutch factor to perform when the lights are brightest players like faker and guma always ramp up as competition gets stiffer and others like chovy peanut zeusfinals only seem to come to halt the first change will be doran becoming teamless you are getting the boot my friend sorry heres the correct translation for the last part geng is and always will be a choke team in all seriousness they are a good team but they just keep failing at the same things its been happening for a while now and is hard to cheer for them without getting disappointed everyone expect a team to get better over time minimizing the mistakes and fixing the strategies they take but they seem to be way past their prime and still declining with this said i hope they rise again the same with dk actually welcome geng canyon after that flash lmao doran expecting to go to lcs that means i wont get an offer welcome to team liquid doran riot buffs hullbreaker and choky goes top and joins t spoiler tag strong team lmao they just lost to china if this org wants any chance of success internationally they are gonna have to clear house in the upper half of the map chovy included doran peanut chovy have all cemented the fact they are completely unreliable once the competition leaves domestic grounds if lck titles are all they care about then by all means keep all of these players because they are kings of the lck but just accept that you will never find success outside of that there is gonna be lot of change this year a lot canyon and sm will most probably split t will most probably split too kt players splitting player like zeka kinger and viper will also go for another team scout want to comeback to lck we will se lck exodus v this year with salary cap only t geng will survive i think they all played well today its just the game has different levels they have to blow up this roster if they want international results because this one just isnt it with how he got gapped by biin im not sure its going to be we anymore ouch after today thats one way to announce you think you will be dropped poor dude top showmaker on ksante jungle faker mid chovy adc bulldog tristana support bdd my question is how many players will straight up retire as they all seem like they hate the fking game now i know the lck doesnt import but i wonder if it might be worth it to just screw regional pride and import an lpl top laner lol lpls top lane pool is insane rn compared to lcks chovy and peyz are untouchables the best mid and adc currently playing in lck and perhaps they might keep delight because of his sinergy with peyz they could build around them something like theshy kanavi chovy peyz delight it is going to be the most expensive roster but i cant see them losing to anyone doran has to be the one to go everyone else on the team was a standout player domestically doran was fine but fine isnt good enough internationally damn this is the mentality they had going into blg match doran and peanut should be out on their asses for those performances not flashing that j ult on its own should be bench and a fine at minimum you always pick akali and yone against neeko then you get statchecked by opponents j and ksante tell me did you ever manage to kill those bruisers is it that hard to master orianna in one season dude you always first pick akali or yone and you played akali like shit not going to lie aside from peanut the entire roster could use a cleansing peanut may have looked like he was getting gapped hard but he was actually a huge reason the series was even close dude was throwing his own gold and exp out the window to attempt to facilitate his team either champ pool issues or bad drafts by geng most of the series as well btw adc and top were the biggest issues imo after drafting putting such a high caliber support on enchanters just because your adcs champ pool is suspect was so cringe by them doran just getting gapped all series as well thank you chovy and doran not with you apparently doran you dont know because you wont be in geng anymore xd honestly doran needs to go its not like he is bad but he really got gapped in top in terms of who else geng need to get rid of im guessing they keep the bot lane peanut could be next on the chopping block he has been making weird plays during worlds and i guess its the nerves probably but its far from the usual jungler we see domestically in the lck i hope this org rebrand to national disgace aie at international events what a spoiler of a title chovy needs to go he cannot handle the big stage much like zeus unironically peanut was the best player on gen g by a fuckin mile yeah his ass is gone please give chovy a real top laner

used a ruler with mm to measure my bar bc im just that desperate for some hope but no movement at all lolll tickets are already being resold as we queue what a joke to be honest if there are no more tickets left why do they still keep us in queue like stop playing with my heart pls i know its only presale but its really disappointing to not get tickets despite playing the game for over a decade attending multiple events and bots will obtain the tickets to scalp why cant providers make you have to attach your id to a booking and that person must be present with the group my bar has barely moved its looking kinda doomed axs is just a licenced scalper system it stops external resale but it also allows resale through its own site so there is no reason for scalpers to not just buy and instantly resell ufc london tickets had the same issue where before anybody could even get in tickets in the nosebleeds would already be up for very disappointing to see axs being used for this bro i live mins from the o istg if i dont get a ticket ill ac cry nice to know its not only me going to be well pissed off if people are buying tickets right now fair system my ass i finally got out of queue just to get the message that the queue link is not available sad no more tickets just got this when i got in http im very pissed i was waiting for minutes the bar got full and redirected me to a broken page managed to get into premium ones and could have got the last tickets but were each the bar for normal pre sales hasnt moved a shambles like usual yo same here http i have it open on device on browsers best of luck for future reference each browser login has its own queue id not in the screenshot so if you use multiple browsers you get multiple queue ids chances my bar also hasnt progressed at all same for all my friends im going with its not looking too good for getting tickets but ah well no progress so far different tabs on different networks multiple people and the queue doesnt progress in any lol we have more than tabs total my bar is still at on different devices guess im not getting tickets deleted i have been in the waiting room since it started and i have moved maybe up slots in minutes i was also in the o presale minutes in when it opened and they were sold out in minutes its all in shambles i got x tickets after refreshing the page for the past minutes a tickets too but priceykeep trying guys deleted how can this be so difficult ugh were logged in on three devices and the bar isnt moving at all on two of them well see how it goes tomorrow i guess been in queue since and no bare movement for me either i took the mastercard presale and it finished the blue bar at my screen and i got forewarded to the sale site where it said that the link is invalid does anyone knows whether that means that all tickets are sold out for today or had the same issue dont wanna want it to happen tomorrow these tickets are harder to get than the korean ones and ive been to every world final except season the main general sale will likely be a lot better but dont forget about the league partner links that they havent informed most of you about they can be shared between anyone who has the link not just the partner themselves this usually goes live before general sale just wanna say gl to everyone tmr especially if u live close to the o like me or in london i rly hope we all get a ticket cuz getting an esports even in london has been rare for the games i at least play league val pretty sure their server crashed devices got in white blank screen refreshing didnt do anything got in after mins everything was gone mine is moving but very slowly hoping for the best for everyone mine is about it did moved bit just a tiny bit so i dont think ill get it its still at bar yup bar isnt moving at all e got in after minutes got the message that all tickets are sold no luck devices its really sad no bar movement or if any its minimalalmost as bad as buying tswift tickets i got msi finals floor tickets last year in general sale had no luck with the mastercard or pre venue its a few thousand only being sold for presale which makes it ass still here no luck there are no tickets left minutes in now they closed the shop i was refreshing maybe if some were left behind but now after refresh its just a white screen with nothing on it hey guys might not help anyone but if you are still on the there are currently no tickets available it might be worth sticking around and occasionally refreshing the page i got through to this message after only mins but after half an hour a premium ticket did become available which i snagged apparently worked for others yesterday as well just got in for the link to be invalid good hour wasted heres a funny thing it loaded finally for me just to get a message your link has expired or link is invalid or something like that and then kicked me out d when going back or refreshing it says oh your queue popped then too bad requeue got in after mins or so all tickets were gone by then no tickets left just got in guys we just got two tickets for gbp in total so theres still a couple of tickets worst shotgun i ever attempted was in the waiting room min before on two different pc one hasnt move and the other is probably at of being completed seems like i will be back tomorrow morning for the general admission i was logged in on laptops a phone and a computer and got flagged as a bot before the queue even opened it flagged my ip address so i now im just logged on on one laptop that i connected to a g hotspot from my phone i started the queue as soon as it opened at and im still in the queue my bar on the phone moved all the way and then i was hit with the message there are currently no tickets available xd queue not moving at all well my fault for not using my o priority yesterday got in at no tickets available edit keep refreshing i saw that there were tickets available in different levels but when i tried to buy they were already sold again in but its just showing loading circle nth yet http just got in no tickets available still kept refreshing after min of queue http stayed in the entire time

makes me wonder what the fucking point of the queue is tbh im disgusted by this happens every year with worlds but hurts more because i live an hour away and cant go i cannot wait to see all the empty seats at the finals this was going to be my only birthday present and scalpers have ruined it all thanks to a system that wholly favours them outstanding execution from axs i did open queue on two different devices with different ip and im stucked at the very start on both queue not moving at all feels like august all over again it is sold out got in no tickets availible so fkin shit also paused in queue ffs in my hometown and i cant even go the way it should work is that say exact number unknown this is just an example people get in immediately and then as each of them logs out or their min session ends its one in one out working through the queue the problem is that if one of those is a bot which is almost guaranteed due to the sheer number of them they share their nonunique link with other bots who then all flood the site and buy all the tickets the fact that the tickets sell out immediately is a giveaway that this is whats happening if the links werent being shared to exceed the intended number of people who get through the tickets would sell at a slower and steady rate as people go in and out the virtual revolving door deleted would at least be nice if they were honest that it was just sold out i cant spend all day at work staring at a totally bullshit queue system ive set up a discord server for anyone who want to team up together tomorrow and share queue link once someone gets in if this isnt allowed please let me know and ill remove mods http queue now paused great joined the queue as soon as it opened so like mins before pm and havent moved at all this has been the hardest year to get tickets period and ive been to almost every world final even korea was easier than this and thats saying something fnatic queue pause hack got in minute in axs kicked me out ibstantly due to timeout go eat a bag of dicks absolutely incompetent bufoobs yep min in and the limited number pops up min and the queue paused again see yall tomorrow same time queue is paused already and ive seen people saying that they were all sold out within minutes hence the message at id love to actually test to see if the link once you get past the queue isnt unique would be hilarious and not surprising at all if true guess ill try again tomorrow looking forward to seeing the number of tickets go up on the scalping sites fumingggg how is the link not unique is this even fair whats the point of putting us in a queue like this my queue finally moved ever so slightly initially unlike yesterday lol half the venue is going to be empty at this rate seeing all the resellers online you go to x ticket sites etc s of tickets being sold on there for insane prices the queue is paused does it mean sold out theyve pretty much destroyed the experience for me ive been in all of the sales trying to get one single ticket for myself as ive been saving up for a long time for this trip now welp i guess i can go f myself with that money now thanks bots been trying to get my boyfriend tickets for his bday booked a while trip around it just to be sure only for them to be sold out for the third time the queue is paused the queue has been paused for a while now i think its gone again same as last time more attention needs to be drawn to all this kind of stuff its crazy these days big post got removed that was bringing attention to it before what average human fan can pick their seats and input all their details in under min for it to be getting warning messages after min about being sold out etc can we just boycott and not buy from scalpers make the venue as empty as possible please empty stadium pog stuck at fresh out the waiting room oh well try again tomorrow cant wait to see all the new tickets on viagogostubhub i dont know anyone whos managed to get tickets and based on this thread preeeeetty crazy that this always fucks up so badly literally just want to see worlds in my home country as i missed it years ago none of my friends were able to get tickets in any phases im beginning to question is tickets even exist maybe the arena is just filled with bots i have separate remote sessions at work connected to pcs going all at once and additional on ios only one bar had moved further than the others and all on pause i just need tickets lmao yeah its a joke man same nonsense happened in august im still in the queue its been hours do i just give up now had it confirmed they are all gone what will it be tomorrow the same thing no tickets after min also stuck in queue so sad over an hour paused btw actually so unprofessional yep theyre being sold on secondary platforms starting as pounds for the worst seats queued since and once hit they automatically linked me for the ticketsale tomorrow absolute bs system has worlds ticket purchasing always been like this i had better chances securing coldplay and taylor swift tickets any news is it worth staying or is everything already sold wait so am i wasting my time by staying in queue even tho its been hours the queue is paused for and a half hours this is a joke ive been in queue for more than two hours on two devices trying to get a ticket for a friend queue was paused few minutes in and hasnt moved since what a joke why are tickets even transferable wow im shocked i thought it would be better in europe na worlds was the same thing we had people on different computers try to get tickets and not a single person even got to the ticket selection screen its disgusting that these companies can make so much money providing a service that does absolutely nothing so how do i get a bot to get tickets for myself like how are they getting to the tickets first do note ticket sales for venues tend to be rd party for anything so if there are problems with it its generally not riots or who ever is using the venue at that times fault sales postponed anyone see the tweet riot posted idk why they dont just make it purchasable via riot accountclient the second wave will always have far less tickets than the first wave worlds mastercard they make a mastercard for league of legends deleted its in their best interest to make it sell out asap and pump up the numbers artificially with bots and resellers sadly easy way to point towards the sales times and numbers to show investors that theyre making money hand over fist in a really short time its not bots youre competing against the entire world for tickets there are likely a couple million people across the globe trying to get tickets and the demand is incredibly high did some bots and scalpers get tickets probably but the vast majority of the people who want tickets are fans just like you and the reality is there just isnt enough supply edit there are currently tickets on resale marketplaces in an arena seating but keep telling yourselves its all bots and scalpers that got the tickets its the same bullshit as taylor swift fans dont want to admit theyre cannibalizing each other because its much easier to just blame ticketmaster and scalpers and throw a fit when there are a million people who want to see an event and only available tickets youre most likely not going to get a ticket i hate to break it to you but thats the reality

really do anything about it unless they themselves operate the ticket sales which of course would make the whole thing a shitshow cause why would riot have the knowledge and the people specialized in this kind of service emailing riot doesnt do anything they do not provide the service they just hire the company that does it is damai not distributing the tickets this year they were in previous years and they require foreign passport numbers to be entered and you had to bring the passport to scan in this was anti scalper there are millions of people that want to attend worlds in china and only s of thousands of seats purely off of numbers tyere are just going to be a lot of people disappointed keep in mind that during the swiss round some chinese nationals bought tickets on uutix by listing their passport place of issue as hong kong or taiwan theyre basically betting theyll still be let in since their passport number and name match even though the country doesnt and the platform is meant for foreigners in the official sale this will likely get worse for the shanghai and chengdu rounds and there are already plenty of posts about it on xiaohongshu ive contacted uutix about this issue and i encourage other foreigners to do the same to help keep the process fair this happens at every worlds i had to buy finals ticket from scalpers last year just to be able to visit atleast semifinal tickets were obtained legit will not change until people stop paying for scalped tickets let them have one year of an empty stadium and see how quickly they create a backup for scalped tickets my guess would be something a long the lines of them requiring you to lock in your ticket with a name attached to it within days of the event or your ticket can be considered abandoned and they will resell it either online or in person just to make sure the seat is filled terms and conditions baby semis for nd nov sold out first followed by st nov then st oct i bought a ticket for th oct not sure how buyers are going to get in via scalpers considering the tickets are linked to individual passports one ticket per person riot bad final boss scalpers deserve to be scalped for what its worth at least in the worlds semifinal mastercard presale there were very few tickets available and it seemed like it was doomed but then in the general sale there was plenty of availability that might have been partially due to the last minute city switch though and finals were still sold out instantly iirc op just mad tickets were limited per person are nontransferable and require passport and name on card to match with the time of purchase these were super antiscalper its just a presale of of the seats in the most popular esports country with the highest population of course they were gonna sell out fast try again october rd when the other of tickets get released its the most popular esport on the planet of course presale tickets will all be gotten immediately weird how this is an issue for worlds but not msi i was able to get tickets for msi easily is it a china vs canada problem or something how can scalping work when you have to enter your passport number when buying in msi also in chengdu they absolutely did care that its linked to your passport there was a special lane for nonchina citizens and you had to show your passport number matches and all that scalping can still work to a smaller extent you can get tickets which means you can sell at least one of the tickets but at least its not as bad then it could be stop buying from scalpers if you do you are part of the problem gone in less than one second again can any international fans confirm if they were able to actually get tickets deleted do we even have any chance on the rd happens every year unfortunately also happens in most sportsconcerts i went to worlds in france and msi in vancouver and there are always people trying to sell tickets at the last minute for a loss im sure china will have a little bit more demand but my strat has usually worked for weekday games ill be traveling around china at the same time hoping to grab some last minute tickets and a train to bejing yep same thing last year at worlds they are not even trying to fix it at this point i think a better solution would be to move to an email verification system for the remaining tickets fans could register their interest by email and when tickets go live verified fans receive an exclusive link if they dont complete checkout within minutes the link expires and the next batch of emails goes out this cycle continues until the tickets are gone if there are still leftovers after that then they could be listed back on the ticketing platform as a final option this way real fans at least stand a chance and scalpers have a harder time sweeping everything instantly somewhat related but i managed to get a semis ticket for a friend but keyed his passport wrongly by one number called uutix and they told me hed still be let in since name and passport generally matched do you think thatd be the case happens every single year sadly you absolutely can get a ticket resellers prey on fomo right when tickets get released but prices will go down if you wait where did you think bot farms originated from you have chance from the beginning how does buying resell tickets work if its linked to your passport scalptastrophe i see everyone saying how this happens for every live event but the last one i went to was the australian travis scott concert and through waiting i was able to get the tickets not sure if whether that event sold tickets differently or i just got really lucky isnt the solution personal tickets riot organized events are the worst compared with all the other companies i hope they get bought because their current esports handling is killing the game slowly the only trick ive found out is camping by that i mean being ok with waiting for event or concerts to start and grabbing a ticket for cheap i dont think riot can do much last time i went to worlds was on and despite koreans having government issued unique id i still heard rumors about scalping and honestly with how many people entered the place in such a short amount of time i would assume checking is practically impossible simple barcode swipe during entrance will take good seconds to let say k people in within an hour which is seconds you will need gates on full speed any human error will make that second into maybe seconds and things become impossible pretty quickly scalping has ruined concerts pokemon cards pretty much anything that is supposed to be fun is barred by greed and if you want to have fun you have to pay the bandits to proceed isnt this the usual story with anything nowadays always happens exact same thing for me i with my mom waiting in queue too instant sellout how about no one go to the event and these idiots who buy tickets lose their money should make only one ticket per riot account bind with phone number can you link me to the scalpers please just watch on stream like the rest of us loooool worlds tickets have always been a shit show grass is green and the sky is blue most people are discouraged by the visa requirements for china anyway the number of foreigners coming extra for worlds must be so insignificantly low and besides you can mail riot all you want they have no say in china matters the people who do this and with pokmon cards need to get a life sad fucken losers deleted the selling of tickets should have been tickets per account only this is just so sad to those real esports fans scalping being effective just means the tickets were priced lower than what people were willing to pay for them its not an actual issue thousand dollars for worlds ticket lmao

are some things that money cant buy for everything else there is steves mastercard didnt riot have back in the day the mastercard card where if you added balance to the account you would get a sum of rp aswell i wonder how much bigger than state farm jersey mikes and acer na lcs sponsors this deal will be good to hear hope it works out its happeninghttp blue essence turning into a real currency when riot heard about monetizing the league scene they took it literally hopefully they can take their casters to korea now instead of making them watch the game and casting it from la lol riot lives real talk i hope they can start actually making bank off esports not even challengercard lul holy shit what happened while i was in jail braum is here to save your credit score lee sin just do it skin coming soon moneeeeeeeeeeeeyy here comes the money money money money money money money so is it going to be like world of warcraft where its just mastercard rewards lol siren cassiopeia renegade talon pulsfire ezreal running it down in this guys promos because he took your bluebuff priceless looking forward to seeing the actual numbers involved here hopefully its a sign of things to come so we will hear now mastercard at every replay d the teams will square off today on mastercards rift to decide who is the better squad did someone say ahri mastercard that sexism scandal is paying off not sure how i feel about this im happy esports is getting serious investors but i dont know if advertising lending and credit to kids is a good idea its really easy to make a slippery slope argument to preadetory lending oh wow that is a pretty big deal i really hope the clubs see a cut of this deal you know because of franchising and all now that they have moneys maybe the can shed this small indie company meme by allowcating money to fix stuff client death report intingtrolls lobby report system nothing to see here folks just capitalism advertising credit card for kids hopefully this will help us get back on track to having truly major events and not this lcs studio bs that they did for allstars and msi hopefully it turns out better than the american express serve card thing they did a few years back removed didnt we have this already in season where you sign up for a card and use it to buy rp you get bonuses this aint new nice i have two mastercards already after reading that i am more proud of having a mastercard d is this mainly for lcs hope it works they actually need the money lol maybe the casters can go to worlds now sponsorships left and right cuts esports budget from caster desk f for the people with visa oh wow wack wow i am really excited about to we made some mfer money rp cash back cream there needs to be that meme where the boss asks for ideas on making profit and people say some shit like partner with mastercard make chromas and then the guy who says why dont we crowdfund and gets thrown out the window not hard to be the biggest when riots had trouble monetizing their league just saying they had a deal with amex a long time ago i got over rp for free looks like im getting my first credit card so last time league did this i was able to go to my bank and have a direct deposit of put on the card which i cancelled after transactions this fulfilled the direct deposit clause and then i used the i put on the card for any small purchase i could think of a drink here a snack there etc i believe i ended up with k rp and didnt really spend any money that i would have regularly spent damn even riot getting dank sponsorships i got the amex card in and couldnt get a direct deposit for a few months and then they ended the program goodbyekrp t mastercard ad confirmed none goes to the players anyway im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit rwallstreetbets would this be a good time to buy otm ma and tcehy calls with strikes a few weeks outhttp nbspif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads infortotesmessenger contactmessagecomposetortotesmessenger they will sponsor with their line of credit so they cant default please bring back the champion splash arts on cards i thought this was a joke from the title alone tbh id mastercard all my purchases if i get some rp from the transactions i saw mastercard ads in the psgliv game today i didnt even know they were still in business let alone fucking massive been looking to get a credit card lately to build credit i guess ill just wait for this oh boy watch there be an exclusive skin duo when this deal goes through mastercard yi and a twisted fate skin except for he throws credit cards crazy deal for riot oh hai can riot turn down the skins outcome then i cant spend all that money every month for release exclusive bundles i am super excited for this even though i am not a mastercard user visa is definitely behind on all of this ooh nice do we get a lux printhttp on this one please just go full sellout so you can grow as a company but is it the walmart rewards mastercard walmart employee btw kinda weird given the declining viewership of lol esports but any money is good i kinda expect it to be limited to a year full lcs type deal which isnt bad if youre an old company like mastercard who is testing the profitability of the esports scene and wants to see what revenues it can generate anyway as ive said gj riot since any money is good money at this point nice mastercard best sponsor possible for leagues audience s there is a reason credit card companies are banned from advertising on college campuses not sure a game targeted at children is the best place to advertise this sort of thing and yet theyll cut back prize money and investment into the game even further i wonder if kelby may had anything to do with this context kelby may on hotline league was ranting about riots lack of sponsors in the lcs compared to stuff like the owl and he basically said dude i could sell the lcs to sponsors if i worked for riot its not hard when youre the biggest esport in the world edit getting downvotes but i shouldve said im not serious in that i genuinely believe this lol sorry if that wasnt clear this still will probably never make up for them fucking up the million broadcast deal with bamtech and then technically disney lets be real here biggest deal for a riot sponsorship might not mean much its a really low wall to climb when riots previous deals are the peak case in point the fact that the state farm deal was the biggest money sponsorship in the na lcs yet it was way lower than the smallest sponsorship deal in the owl according to slasher so yeah riot is pretty much still trying to play catch up removed cool now fix the client and servers it only took yearsmassive scandalscommunity backlashtencent anger and a massive loss of incomebut i do hope riot turns this ship aroundand finally properly monetize this game sponsored by steve maybe then they can finally hire enough staff to fix all the issues the client has this reminds me of the old promotion they had going with american express and it was so amazing you sign up for their league prepaid debit card which comes with choice of splash art of various champions or none just for signing up successfully you get rp then you get when you deposit for the first time and when you direct deposit into it then you get rp for your first purchases on it that was a mindblowing amount of rp literally for free i was superhappy with that promotion and i wish they wouldve done something like that again link for those that never saw it http a mastercard riot credit card with rp benefits could be enticing for people who play the game and look to apply for a credit card xb offer bonus rp when you use your mastercard to purchase rp or anything offered by leagueoflegendscomhttp use your credit card anywhere and earn points to redeem for rp at a good value that way your everyday spend can be a way for you to earn rp to play your favorite champs with the skins you want customized credit cards where you can put your favorite skin or set of skins as your credit card design offer a sign up bonus where you spend in a few months and get worth of rp some issues offer back for spend in three months so you have to make the rp value worth the spend or else youd just settle for cash back ded game small indie maybe they should have prepared for this years worlds too oh no master no service if youre to the right of marx card are assholes maybe now they will start paying the balance

remember when riot gave me k rp for beta testing their new client and providing logs because at that time i had a potato pc and they wanted to optimise for it so youre the reason why riot cant fly out casters to worlds from the beginning thinking jk thats fucking nice on reddit a boat load of rp in email a truck load of rp which one is it riot is it a truckload or a boatload of rp ok i have an idea its called visa twisted fate you can paypal me the money or send it to my current account i dont mind youre now sponsored by mastercard every game you must inform your teammates that you will be the mastercard player of the game thank mr mastercard removed klepto tf is suddenly meta if it isnt already the recall animation should be tf attempting to enter his pin code and failing everytime removed bd actually stands for big dick but youll find that out soon enough removed plot twists youre a junior marketing manager at mastercard apple ivern i am waiting for my k rp hi this sounds cool could you link the skin conceptart too edit remembered i could google this so here it is for the others to come http removed removed the real catch here is that your idea can make it into the game which unlike rp cannot be bought with money its every league fans dream well done op you should have declined the rp and claimed the skin as your intellectual property once it was released getting the big bucks so uhm i hope you asked them if its cool to share everything just like this especially because it has their names and the number of the master card dude quick someone make state farm soraka removed hello i am tim and my idea is a mercedes benz rammus skin pls gift me an amg hey long lost best buddie how have you beeeeeen d jk nice man happy for you weird flex but ok congrats now i wish

didnt ask for pax tf how much is k in thank mr mastercard a priceless surprise worth of riot points dollars for an idea that they will use to make with thank mr mastercard good guy mastercard this really encourages other people to come up with more ideas and concepts should have asked for pax tf k rp is a truckload must be a small truck simple for easy pr advertisement someone should give the guys at riot mastercard a raise yo crabnoob its soultakoza so it was you who did the post with tf mastercard i rode it but didnt know it was you ggs my bro hope you enjoys it and start training on tf haha awesome thing to happen congrats you may want to edit those screenshots though to remove contact details like phone numbers pretty cheap price for a good idea basically about or so i feel like k

very small boats peak oh you havent even begun to peak but you will youre going to peak all over everybody make it work uangryhotelcustomer make it work holy well done dude nice one man this is cool whats kinda sad is that this gesture came from the sponsor while riot tends to borrow ideas for skins from fans and theyll never recognize them not even gifting that skin grats i would just settle for my old banned account with all my legacy shit from season and merged to my new account lol heard they were giving accounts back via apology letters i was the first ever apology letter like years ago or whenever season was yet they tell me i cant have my stuff back and then use my idea to release peoples accounts to them wth i feel screwed edit put the letter on the forums year ago apologizing to the community and developers for being toxic and having a bad attitude obviously a good idea i feel like riot is that boss who steals ideas at this point go ahead riot look it up then ask me what the account name was ill be more than happy to prove it and yet i got nothing for stance stance revoludyrhttp talk about some champion favoritism the real winner of worlds this year wait please dont tell me they are actually introducing that skin into the game thats just sellout in a nutshell why is mastercard giving you rupiah isnt that like or does rp mean something different in league advertising reddit off with their heads giving a tiny amount of virtual money to one person in exchange for advertising reddit to the front page god you people are dense i dont want this this a bad idea inb my

types of scams that i am traumatized haha awesome stuff dude no god dammit now this sub is going to be filled with shitty skin posts instead of filled with shitty skin posts like it is now i really dont think they should go through and make a mastercard tf skin it is disrespectful to the character itself and just cheapens them and the game and makes them into corporate shills there is a transcendent quality to a character that is loyal to its identity but to drag that character down as a mascot for a worldly endeavor would make it lose that timeless quality bill watterson had it right when he refused to license calvin and hobbes and cash in on the merchandising it would have destroyed the characters and they would have lost their timeless quality this is why everyone loves calvin and hobbes still bc they are free of worldly affects and no one gives a crap about garfield which is tied down by mammon dolls shirts movie deals hailcorporate no comments calling this out for rhailcorporate but a bunch of randomly deleted ones deleted wow really nice does this mean theyre planning to actually use the idea thats very nice of them wow this sounds awesome congrats to you

to spend some of that rp you could always send it my wayplease hey what about coca cola volibear cokes still a sponsor right question what would happen to the sponsored skins if the partnership between riot and the brand ends so they will make skin or just rewarded a good idea because rewards is nice but i would perfer to see skins from my ideas to be added in game instead and see how people would like them sadly my ideas do not get many upvotes and go unnoticed anyway so whatever wait what tf skin was it i cant tell just by looking so um is this confirmed to be a real skin or is it just a onetime reward for putting mastercard into a fun fan suggestion i propose a miramax khazix skin dont get caught alone when khazax is around iq play by mastercard thanks mr mastercard okay now we

in depth like you and you are amazing and was told off about years ago i thought the olympic skins and the world cup skins were awesome and they could do like pepsi or coke sponsor on the back of a jersey or something the skin maybe even chroma now could be be or something like that either way bravo dope cool most people get money for whoring their soul away but lucky riot they found someone who would do it for fake video game money pretty pathetic my dude you are literally so fortunate to have this congratulations im sure they loved the free advertisement thank card senpai thats nice from riot billion dollar company cant make a working client ty mastercard gratz but i got nothing for my big baller brand idea while nice it was probably their way to buy out your intellectual property

gift in the form of a lifetime subscription please thank you mastercard i kinda hope theyre not considering adding stuff like that to the game i dont think id like that kind of commercialization

2644,t3_qjsq9k,2021-10-31 16:37:13+00:00,Negative,0.7702360395836619,qjsq9k,well my issue with mastercard first item is that it often pop off minute or two after item is finished feels like a goredrinker ad at this point i dont understand how its so difficult for them to time this correctly in game of edg vs geng they got the mythic at they didnt send the notification until what in the fuck are you lazy asses doing make it less loud and make it so its actually on time and not like a full minute or more after when someone buys anything its much better than budlight knight ace brought to you by statefarm if only they did it on time paid thread ad breaks between games should be enough sick of hearing how the reliable cisco network helps the pros play good lol as if cisco has anything to do with the plays pros make just blatant lying ads at this point this post was sponsored by mastercard i feel like this thread is an ad no fuck off mastercard i do not want to be audibly reminded of sponsors except maybe for ad breaks not because casters are mentioning them and definitely not because of some stupid fucking jingle and yes i am most certainly petty enough to deliberately avoid you if you annoy me enough the jingle is definitely very distinct and really good at getting my attention and for that reason i hate it i just want to idly watch the stream while i do something else and the fact that a notification pop off when they complete an item annoys me it feels like getting a text alert everytime a lane hits cs visually it is good but they need to get rid of the sound it just doesnt work half the time and ignores first legendaries lol slightly off topic why are some replays axe replays but others are just regular replays im sick of mercedes axe and verizon so annoying stockholmsyndrome much i wouldnt mind it if it wasnt like a full minute behind when they purchase it its actually so bad its cringe i hate it just because its marginally better than verizon g all chat tweet saying go c or statefarm analyst desk breaking down the red bull power play sponsored by kit kat take a break does not mean that its good better does not always mean good how the fuck does this have upvoted disagree its awful american commercial capitalism is disgusting soooo true i wish we could have maybe the state farm jingle when herald respawns sometimes i dont even notice and its a really catchy tune also teamfights get pretty chaotic often i cant tell whats happening with all the summoner spells going off maybe everytime someone uses ghost it could say redbull gives you wings haha that would be so cool and really help me keep up maybe remake honeyfruit to chicken nuggets and play the im lovin it line when someone eats them lets be honest whats the last time you remember someone eating the honeyfruit oh man so many awesome ideas to help the viewing experience lets hope riot delivers ty mastercard yeah no fuck off shill its incredibly jarring coming from ti to worlds i get ti is community funded so they dont need to put sponsors and ads in but i cant get over how stupid state farm analyst desk and red bull baron power play sound i dont mind the barrage of ads outside of games but it being something constantly mentioned in the product itself seems really out of place nah just remove this and every other ad during the game also stop forcing the casters to shout red bull baron its cringe and unprofessional what does baus say again shilling yea shilling it managed to manipulate twitch chat thats a win i guess jokes aside ty mastercard you should check out lecs recent partnership with sap not only does it give the same alert for when mythics are completed but it also shows the average and fastest build times for items in the split this gives you a really clear idea of how far ahead someone is first person to buy a mythic i guess theyre ahead but when you know that theyve bought their mythic and a half minutes before the average you know roughly how long theyve got their advantage for and how they can affect the map in that time its really great and whilst im sure mastercard can pay the big bucks it actually was a little disappointing to go to the stripped out version for worlds can we talk about the state farm ad do americans really order a fucking liter bottle of ranch what the fuck is going on as a european this whole axe replay red bull baron powerplay thing was new to me but i think these fit into a game stream properly didnt find them annoying maybe a bit funny nah im with britain on this one not a fan of integrations rhailcorporate yes the jingle is loud and annoying they should get rid of it just look at the item tab of the players once in a while and you will see the same thing my hot take its a jarring sound effect that detracts from th game and commentary and needs to be removed or at the very least half as loud i hate the jingle i hate the notification riot needs to reevaluate it absolutely sucks i dont want to see the this when i watch a game how much did mastercard did pay you to write this nice try mastercard i do think the jingle is fine if it was a little less loud what makes it jarring is the fact that not only its a loud sound but it splits my attention between realizing a player bought an item and mastercard why the fuck am i thinking of mastercard midmatch at least the banners blend with summoners rift meanwhile this shit is bright white and loud by the way you will get used to this overtime but then theyll just come up with something else that breaks your immersion to notice an ad which fucking sucks i honestly thought it was a notification for when someone built the goredrinker the ingame ads have got to the point where they completely cheapen and ruin the viewing experience for me nothing is better at ruining the intensity of a game than being reminded that baron is sponsored by red bull you have been visited by the ghost of mastercard goredrinker you have to say mastercard goredrinker times and you will have good luck in your next game god no the mnastercard jungle makes me literally mute the first min of a broadcast just to avoid that god awful sound its already bad enough when you have to hear axe effect replay pwoered by intel or some shit anytime anything remotely happens in game but mastercard jingle is legit annoying and jarring as hell i dont mind some of the sponsors like the images at the bottom left of screen or the showcards during breaks n stuff but stuff like the mastercard thing and some others legit make it not feel like league of legends and more of a glorified ad read over gameplay hot take its invasive and i like the other ones more it distracts me from the game with the sound it makes and i cant help but think its annoying i actually liked fpx money diff and shit like that its less invasive thanks mastercard but i still wont use your credit ty mastercard ftx gold advantage was absolutely the best having that in the lcs makes me really miss it at worlds ty mastercard if we all want league of legends to grow as an esport and get more market share we need to be accepting of advertising yeah it can be a little annoying but it doesnt change the integrity of the game the more money lol generates the more it will expand for everyone commenting the popup is slow as fuck isnt it done when there is nothing happening in game like they wait so they wont interrupt important stuff honestly if this is a real post and not sponsored lke the ad consider psychiatric help cause you are mentally sick im okay with more sponsorship as long as it means production quality and players winnings go up its a sound that happens a couple times during the game and lasts like idk seconds i dont know how people can have the watching experience ruined by that this sub hate for ads is overblown imo lol you wrote an adpositive post on reddit bold people here would prefer phreak streaming still from his basement with walmart knockoff mic and p quality over seeing stupid ads that literally cost us nothing as someone who grew up with cable lol ads are like the tamest shit ever grow up mastercard is ok but i fucking hate the red bull baron power play i agree it is helpful even as someone who has played for years yeah i dont mind it i actually remember blabers olaf was the fastest mythic at just bc of that thing thank you mastercard removed the reason i like it is that i had no idea it was mastercard sponsored while watching there was no intrusive statement that said mastercard paid money for us to include it in a video game unlike the others yea that one is actually cool imo the people that complain about it are literally just looking for things to complain about it i always jam out to it mastercard goredrinker i dont know if its me getting numb to the noise or they actually lowered the volume on that shit by i cant remember my last master card heart attack it kept making me jump cause i didnt expect it and cause its loud af but more to the point i dont mind the ads but the casters especially na casters are extremely obnoxious when it comes to the ads i actually stopped watching the lcs broadcast because of it some mythics lke goredrinker have pretty powerful actives so its a cool nonintrusive way to highlight it it just ridiculous that it usually pops up literal minutes after the item was actually purchased it would be fine if it popped up on first items that give significant power spikes or would make a difference in a lane but it pops up late at seemingly random moments while some people may not like the sound it is jarring for most people and takes you out of the immersion of the game ruining the experience somewhat imagine having that popup every ish minutes into a movie or tv show it just ruins the experience i wish they would add a paid via next to it just for fun lol they missed out on calling it the mastercard mythic mastercard first item powered by goredrinker only issue i have with it is that it was the goredrinker alarm for worlds which isnt a sponsor issue at all i actually disagree the sound effect is sooooo jarring i dont mind some sort of call out but it needs to be a different noise this post is brought to you by yodel thank you mastercard i dont think we have enough sponsors i want a hyundai first blood trojan first brick kia first dragon red bull power play netflix elder hbo double monster triple kill audi quadra kill and the amazon penta parlaying into a bud light ace no i dont think so all these sponsorships integrations just suck and lessens my experience thats why we always say ty mastercard i fucking hate it if theyre going to make it that jarring at least dont make it volume its funny cause whenever i notice it its always a jungler getting goredrinker honestly theyre starting to work though i find myself subconsciously referring to it as red bull baron power play state farm analyst desk and oppo replay when i watch league or when i see this items irl i mean it hasnt triggered to buy insurance buy oppo phones or drink energy drinks yet but half the battle won isnt it the item notification with mastercard im ok with i still despise they call it red bull baron ty mastercard booooooooooo it took me a little while to figure out that sounds was the mastercard alert i kept on thinking i got some kind of error from an app i didnt recognize and kept on checking everything i had open while the game was on my other monitor while i detest ads and sponsorships i see the reason why they are such an integral part of the bigger championships with that said the mastercard alert is the only planted ad that i think has been integrated well its also fun to see twitch chat going ty mastercard okay mastercard you posted on reddit good job ty mastercard this post was sponsored by mastercard the lec has had the little icon update and when they hit level alerts as well its nice to see production value being put into pay for worlds was it last year where the mastercard gold graph jingle was extremely jarring glad they tuned it down the following week their advertising worked the fact that you keep referring to the jingle by the companys name and no other type of name like the first item jingle or the powerspike jingle probably paves the way for even more annoying things like that how many of u even switched to mastercard or got one cause of league lol this post is brought to you by mastercard the item notification yeah if it was on time but all the sponsor things are just so sad last worlds when i first heard a caster say red bull baron power play i cried in real life i think its totally fine but the noise is x louder than anything else on the broadcast i suppose thats the point but its annoying to me its just on par with all the other egregious ads in the broadcast red bull baron powerplay is such a mouthful and its always jarring to hear it i just hope it doesnt end up being far too much and we have things like mid lane being renamed to the mc donalds lane with a big mc donalds logo slapped in the middle of the map my wife commented this with me while watching the semis this weekend all the sponsorship integrations are neat and well integrated in the game scenario well done rito i have the exactly opposite opinion the jingle is so completely out of context and sudden that im constantly thrown off whenever it comes up especially so if the stream is in some background tab i understand the purpose but i dont like the implementation to be fair i dont know how to improve it i just find it very annoying watching worlds after the international is so jarring lol a dozen aggressively advertised sponsorships for like of the prize pool more consumerism more ads more sponsors i want to consume more its just annoying nothing more mastercard is ussless partnership visa is better the ads left such a foul taste that i just stopped watching one day its nothing to do with principles though life is a lot calmer with nothing obtrusive in your face thank you mastercard this isnt a hot take its literally what advertisors were going for youre regurgitating the goal of a group with probably millions of dollars in investing behind it saying that something achieved its explicit goal is not a hot take nice try mastercard theres room for improvement to be made sometimes it highlights very inconsequential completions or ones that are instantly mirrored by the other side which doesnt get a shoutout but the concept is very good i agree edit also the late popup sometimes can be a bit of a throwoff ty mastercard if they can alert on time it would be perfect but its delay a little that one hurts the least i think its because we dont have to hear the casters trip over their tongue trying to say it if they had to say red baron power play once after a team takes it then it would be fine but having hear the poor casters say that over and over again during the duration of the buff hurts then you didnt watch lec they had this but instead it showed instantly and it compared to the average completion time of the split it was actually a great indicator of how ahead someone was ty mastercard

2646,t3_t6qbc9,2022-03-04 19:54:49+00:00,Negative,0.7229413545649984,t6qbc9,ty for revival mmr i have grinded past the smurf queue but it was like games lmao and it was terrible i hope no returning player ever has to deal with that shit edaters in shambles i think the biggest challenge facing moving duos out of solo queue is cultural ask just about anyone who plays flex queue they dont take it as seriously and no one gives any respect to someones rank in flex queue and the whole thing is a selfreinforcing cycle maybe its rosetinted glasses but i think back when it came out people took it more seriously and didnt consider someones flex rank to be entirely meaningless not as serious as soloq but still serious for flex to be a viable place for duos i think riot needs to find a way to fix this and reset peoples perspectives on the queue i dont know how they could do that though they should try to change flexqs name whenif they remove duos from soloq so it can escape some of the stigma it currently has and also change the mmr a bit while at it bring back twisted tree line for the person parties deleted if they want to remove duo queue they really need to fix flex playing flex is fucking awful as a solo its a nightmare as a duo its bad and as a trio is only acceptable the amount of trolling boosted people and other stuff makes for a fucking miserable experience yuumi players in shambles with the removal of duos theres a reason why highelo is soloq only im in favor of the change this is also better for duoq premades too since flexq will be much more compelling previously going to flexq with people was pretty much impossible since groups of know they wont find anyone since duos are in soloduoq and you cant get a group of and an individual player cuz that player is in soloq if this change gets implemented youll always be guaranteed as a premade of to be matched with a premade of and vice versa which opens up a lot of opportunities for cooperative play challenges have nothing to do in this post hope pure solo queue becomes a thing like they mentioned can we please just tie mmr to rank again i dont see why they keep talking about how accurate matchmaking is when i see posts a fair amount about how it feels like shit mmr not being coupled to your rank seems like an ever present mistake everyone is ignoring solo queue only is a risky move from a matchmaking standpoint it is clearly better it will provide way better matches and a better experience for those playing solo but this is a video game and one of the major draws is to play duos with your friend and for that to mean something youre progressing the same ladder you normally do solo but with a buddy it does hurt the competitive integrity of ladder but it is also a major driving force for a lot of people to play at all yes duos can just play flex and it might make flex more popular but the fact that its a separate rank makes people look down on flex its a lesser mode if they cant influence their real rank playing with their friend theyre just going to go to another game where they can maybe theres a way to give a strict solo option like in dota but even there the nonstrict solo feels like a crapshoot i feel like players would just only ever use it and playing duos would be way worse than they are currently riot i am literally just going to not play the game if you make me be matched with a random support its just not worth it in the current game state to me solo should have been actually solo no duos or anything from the beginning of the game lol boosting companies in shambles i really hope this works out however if flex queue they should rebrand it becomes a competitive queue worth being proud of boosters will just move to flex they will need an answer for that adcsupp is saved since ppl cant duo like its hella cringe vs a duo bot as a non duo even roles like top jg or midjg were cringe when u had to vs duos the only reason why soloduo queue exists is because it was a thing in the start of the game if solo queue was pure solo queue in s people wouldnt try to have duo queue in the current queue what does blind pick look like if we guarantee you can get the champion you want to play and not have to fight for it in champ select blind pick should work like hots you queue a champ and figure out where you go in game if you want to go a specific lane play draft there is an issue is this would have imbalanced team comp but people dont even care about team comp ranked and play whatever they want ctrl f voice comms results close tab pure soloq also makes the games better for people that actually queue up as a solo player im very excited for solo only well at least they are addressing the fact that flex queue is awful and needs to be fixed if they want to change solo queue moving forward what does blind pick look like if we guarantee you can get the champion you want to play and not have to fight for it in champ select riot you already did this it was called team builder and it was great this means that in order to keep the game healthy its also important to continually revisit your other game modes on a regular basis we get to ask ourselves what do changes that make our nonranked queues as healthy as possible look like where the fuck was this kind of discussion when dominion and twisted treeline were live game modes the root cause of this is the high number of person parties that want to play together with not enough s and s to fill them out as these soloduo players can just opt to play a different game mode this can cause those matchmaking envelopes to expand to a point where queue times and quality expectations cannot reconcile almost sounds like a new v game mode on a new map with its own ranked ladder could be a nice addition to the game and the huge amount of player parties idk if its an unpopular opinion but i think id stop playing the game if they removed duos flex is a joke of a competitive que and i personally only enjoy the game when im playing with friends and were trying to take it seriously maybe clash can be that but they really need to do something with flex que removing duo queue is one of those things the vocal minority on this sub wants and i guarantee if this change is implemented it backfires it only took riot over fucking years to consider the implementation of an actual solo queue ranked mode and they first had to go through the absolute fiasco that was dynamic queue unreal less autofill no more annoying bot duos i am all in personally as someone that only plays soloq by myself i would love to eliminate duos solo only mode in order to match player intent andprovide the healthiest competitive individual queue possible werereevaluating our take on soloduo and exploring a world where soloplayers play in solo queue and premades play in ranked flex or organizeds modes please im begging you make this happen duos can already play in flex let soloq be an actual soloq with no premades i understand why other people want to play with their duo but just go play flex if thats the case boosting would be eradicated what about the thousands of chinese shared boosted accounts it is really obvious to spot those accounts as well tyler has exposed this on multiple occasions also in theory any game mode could be similar to flex que if riot for once just decided to test voice comms outs almost every single game in the world has voice comms except for league of legends a game that is team oriented removing duo will literally make people quit the game this comment section really shows the target audience of rlol and why its not representative of the playerbase at all putting duos into flex wont make flex any more competitive at all as dynamic queue showed its hilarious that people are already shitting on all duo players as abusers but somehow think that flex will be considered respectable removing duos from ranked will be removing a large social aspect from league and as far as i can see that only hurt the playerbase because i dont think there will be a comparable resurgence of soloonly players to offset that team based games like league have draw largely because they are social experiences nice i always soloq as support and i feel like i have such a disadvantage vs a premade who is most likely on voicecomms flex queue will always be an issue because theres no incentive for solo or duo players to join whats the point of picking it over sd queue queue times are longer and you risk getting ostracized by a group thats more likely to play off each other than play off you unless something changes i dont see any scenario where flex queue improves in its current state boosted players are mad as hell dont worry tho you can still get carried in flex implement soloq and fix low mmr scaling and were golden what does blind pick look like if we guarantee you can get the championyou want to play and not have to fight for it in champ select just replace blind pick with the old teambuilder system except instead of getting to pick your teammates it just matchmakes you with people playing different roles holy shit theyre finally starting to genuinely consider solo only mode oh my god i seriously hope this happens this not only would make solo queue so much better and more fair but it would also add an incentive to play flex people could flex without worrying about duo queue mmr consequences for example fuck man i hope we get solo only queue since even just knowing that everyone is solo that alone would tilt me much less and id love to play flex since this would cause a lot more people to play flex since many people play duo queue mainly which would help flex to not only be seen as a more serious mode but also give it much higher traffic overall they should test this out just like they tested dynamic queue and role queue i really wish riot would expand upon the current lack of meaningful communication in soloduo queue before they begin removing the option to have at least one person to strategize with botsupport as one of the more substantial role duos to support keeping it currently we have only a handful of pings enemy has vision isnt included in the radial menu that are spammed frequently negative text chat surrender calls flaming other players and no voice chat edit riot has neglected improving player comms for season after season and has only come down harder on duo queue despite it being one of the last ways to strategize in a competitive mode outside of clash forcing duos into flex doesnt make the queue any more legitimate riot has neglected flex as a competitive queue since forever it became a glorified normal draft after they removed the rank constraints and its always felt like a halfbaked idea when they removed ranked vs all they need to do is remove duoq from soloq and make flexq where you can only queue up with people division between there is no reason why diamondmaster players should be queueing up with ironbronze players in flexq if you a really high level player and want to play with your low elo friends just go to normals interesting read especially about flex too many trios in flex no one soloduo perhaps removing duo in solo queue would solve this issue lol im not convinced removing duos is a good idea the impact duos have over of the ranked population is greatly exaggerated a lot of people only play ranked with friends because league is a free game everyone has i dont think duos will move to flex either its going to be really hard to get rid of the idea that flex is the joke game mode people are still only going to care about soloqueue rank inb stfu youre a duo boosted e insert whatever is used most this month here support main i never duo i also dont have issues with duos either and i play both support and mid two roles that feel the impact the most pretty much the only thing duos amount to is a teammates focusing another teammate more i think this restriction would make the most sense at high elo only i just dont see it doing anything but hurting lower ranks sounds like solo only queue is going to happen almost certainly seems to solve every problem they list and bring in new advantages could be a great idea especially for lower queue times less autofillsecondary role and no boostinghigher quality matches id take the trade offas long as they actually happen which is another problem daaamn im looking forward to solo only queue im tired of playing premades vs pairs of premades and toxic duos or premades playing top and bot and never interacting with each other solo only queue is a great idea to provide everyone an even playing field it should of been only solo from the start duoing makes alot of balancing problems and a way for people to reach unfair ranks it is most prevalent in botlane with an adc support combo like kogmaw lulu against solo players the duo is very likely to win lane and snowball the game than if they were both solo players not ever returning to play if you are taking duos away im not playing flex queue absolutely not people literally laugh at others who even try and mention flex queue this game will continue to spiral downwards at this point and it makes me sad ive loved this game for so long but it might be time to let go for the love of god please implement voice chat all this competitive talk is irrelevant if you dont do justice and have voice chat league is a team game we need soloq only to balance our teambased game alrighty remove flex bring back treeline does that mean flex as premades will be possible or will it still be limited to players max if reducing queue times by means i cant duo queue with my friend i am quitting the game sorry people in here may disagree but i cant see removing duoq doing anything but kill the game hey isnt this game fun to play with your friends too bad you cant nobody uses flex ever killing duo might as well kill the game for so many people including myself i dont think i spent more than dollars on league but i am willing to pay money for a pure solo queue yall premades gonna downvote me now but you know that you always play for your friend and dont even try to convince me otherwise duo with jungler other lanes can forget about seeing their jungler during the laning phase premade botlane oh lemme say it i fucking hate premade botlanes for me its the perfect example of yasuo case when they are in my team the chances for enemy botlane to carry the game rises to about when premade botlane is in the enemy team it is usually combination of otp draven and one million mastery thresh that makes lifes of my team botlane a misery said premades will absolutely always defend their friend even if he did the single most stupid thing that the summoners rift has seen you trying to politely say that man ryze ult in between tier and tier turrets while enemy team has galio and mf with ults up might not be an optimal play you gonna get flamed by both of them cuz they always be more brave than a solo player because they have their brother in flame nearby above refers to like of premades that i see in my games so you can try to convince yourself that you are in remaining but we all know the truth or instead of creating a whole new queue system and fragmenting the playerbase further you could just add voice comms to even the playing field with duos like what every other competitive game has but no riot is going to find some roundabout solution that adds even more problemsbugs than they had intended groovy workable thumb automatic fact nail unique tidy money pocket the biggest problem and only problem is smurf queue and they didnt even mention it its an absolute disaster literally everyone who dared to not have time to play their placements at the begining of the season is absolutely fucked by being in this degenerate queue the fact riot doesnt care about the queue being good but instead does their best to manipulate people into thinking the queue works correctly is just shameful im disappointed dodging wasnt mentioned here dodge penalties created a lot of new problems with smurfs gave trolls more power and forced people to play games they cant win whether its due to bad matchups bad team comps or trolls i cant believe there is an entire post about competitive integrity but nowhere does it mention the possible addition of voice communication league is a game with some of most complex team play of any game ever created yet the staple competitive mode of play limits me to typing to my teammates people who are concerned about toxicity can turn it off is there literally no way for man teams to play ranked i really miss when you could do that there is just no way for my friends and myself to play ranked if we happen to be just the four of us that day which is a lot of days since everyones schedules are different we are often person short of a full stack would love to know if this problem is going to be addressed im all for the idea if people really want it to be a soloonly queue but i really hope they actually fix the community stigma against flex queue before they do it as it is now no one takes it seriously because oh its just flex queue its not your real rank and thus people dont take it seriously i like playing ranked with my friend but we dont play on flex simply because of how people just dont take it seriously like they do soloqueue ranked who the hell will want to play solo supportsolo adc consistently playing adc or support on solo only sounds like hell i would miss soloduo quite a bit just not the same to queue with your duo in a flex duo abusers punching air rn solo only mode lets gooooooo solo q get better by yourself flex q practice for competitive clash competitive are people getting mad because they cant be boosted or turn their brains off and let their duo with for them like this looks perfect on paper instead of having just a copy of the same lobby but in one of them you can play with people instead of just and for the people complaining that you cant play with friends now um what in what universe are you living in where riot is going to come out and remove the ability to play league with friends lmao you might lose the ability to be carried to a new rank by your buddies that doesnt mean youve lost the ability to play video games with them theres always been the ability to play with your friends on this game youre just addicted to ranked i might play ranked again if they finally remove premades from solo queue adc is unplayable solo queue dont remove duo the day that riot removes duos from soloq is the day i stop playing ranked completely i cant play soloq by myself as a jungle main its far too toxic to deal with by myself am i the only one who would be devastated by the removal of duo in soloduo my friend and i pretty much solely play soloduo together and have absolutely no interest in flex queue ranked or climbing on there we pretty much only want our solo rank to rise and invest time into that this would basically make the game unplayable for him and i together and force us to only play on our own so glad to see riot acknowledging premades are a problem in ranked now if only theyd acknowledge this outside ranked too just so i can see the premades arent a problem quit whining crowd get outed as being part of the i dont play league solo demographic this is a great change im not entirely black pilled on riots decisions anymore oh wow nice i will never have to face premade duos in bot lane again honestly this is the best news ive seen for solo queue specifically in a long time adding duos throws way too much mmr discrepancy theres a huge difference for those that duo with versus without voice chat for example solo queue should be queue only add duos to flex thats fine good god please make solo queue fully solo id love to see it i have played tons of ranked with buddies but it was rarely enjoyable and often it feels like premades utterly skew the winrates hard and like you need a premade to stay competitive solo only would be great honestly i like the system as it is soloduo que feels like serious and as close to the real game as you can get other than clash youre supposed to try your hardest to not lose and typically only play champions youre comfortable with and who perform decently normals are an absolute shitshow fiesta that are good for leaning the game or trying out weird and probably stupid buildspositions flex is kind of the happy medium between the two everyone seems like theyre actively trying to win but its not ultra high stakes or anything prepare for getting perma filled adcsupport or be ready for ranked to die this will kill either botlane or the game high elo players beg for years to duo again and they want to remove it for everyone lmao a teamgame where you cant team up riot is something else man i love how most of the comments are about how unfair is to join the duos with teams of people against s suddenly more communication seems unfair and nobody will take them seriously the irony solo soloq god bless fk duos in soloq im legit gonna throw all my money at rito if they make soloq a pure soloq please implement this best change in all of leagues history please duo queue makes queueing solo a god awful experience because youre way more likely to get held hostage if one of the duo is toxic then both are gonna be toxic etc at the same time going against duos makes every role a pain if youre not duo jungler good luck their jg and midsupport are gonna perma invade you or instantly respond to your movement together bot good luck their bot and sup are on coms and picked perfect synergy mid or top good luck their jg and support will hard camp you and make your life miserable theres absolutely no reason for duo to exist other than to continue an old outdated option now do something about the alt accounts and ranked might actually be fun again riot removing duos lets fuckin goooooooooooooooooooooooo guarantee this will lead to a lower overall player base i dont know anyone who takes their flex rank seriously and many only play ranked with a duo due to ladder anxiety competitively better but league is a huge social game hoping it doesnt become the next starcraft if they remove duoq then i simply stop playing ranked with friends flex queue is way too variable in terms of skill even when playing with friends who are the same rank riot seems to be forgetting that for the vast majority of the playerbase duoq is used because its a fun way of competing they will be hitting the fun aspect for more competitive integrity in gold like who cares if a couple of gold games arent the highest quality due to duoq if im on a team with someone in gold vs someone in gold does anyone actually care ive all but quit league at this point but when i do come back around to play its with my friends removing duo would make me never ever play this game again flex queue is a joke duo q in flex has been the most horrible experience ive ever had in league if this change goes through ill have significantly less desire to play the game do i really want me and my duo to always be at the receiving end of a stacks flame fuck no honestly if they removed duos from soloq then a lot of people would just stop playing ranked in general yeah when people talk about boosting they are talking about ranked flex for sure not account sharing and rampant wintrading an insanely out of touch post ifwhen they bring back mmr and remove duos i ll actually pay again it took way to long to grind out yeah as an adult working hours i miss mmr it took way less time to get too your level bring back old v map nice article wish they touched on the health of clash a bit more and people leaving after the first game holy if we get team builder back i will be so happy its just blinds obviously but it was so quirky as an exbooster im amazed that riot still refuses to do anything with account sharing duo gone from solo queue and me and my buddies can find flex games in less than minutes sounds like a win win mmr accuracy is strong where of players are playing with those within a maximum of divisions of their rank with a steady winprediction accuracy to back it up am i the only one concerned by this if some algorithm can say yup you gonna lose that game it might not have been the fair game i wanted in the first place solo only q xayah rakan couples are gonna be pissed one thing i will say riot need to get their shit together when it comes to banning league of legends players who bot cheat or are otherwise involved with account boosting services they are just as bad if not worse than blizzard entertainment in that regard if the valorant team can terminate matches and banhammer players in real time why cant the league team also why arent riots lawyers going after the websites and discord communities that sell boosting or powerlevelling services surely another strategy is to nuke these businesses from orbit through legal action from a high level viewpoint soloduo queue is currently in one of the healthiest states weve ever seen i assume what is meant by this is everything outside of actual gameplay because id say its in one of the worst in game toxicity mental and trolls control too much and are much more efficient at ruining games than ever before regardless if they are on my team or the enemy competitive integrity in league has certainly gone down harsh handouts of ranked only tempperma bans might discourage people from doing so increasing the overall completive integrity solo only mode this sounds like a fantastic change i primarily play solo but i feel like this solves a lot of issues with solo q when it comes to weak players being where they shouldnt many more people are willing to riskpay playing with someone vs handing over their account while it wont fix all issues its a good step duos etc can then rely on flex perhaps doing so will also increase its value this mode should at least be test driven duo boosting would be eradicated that alone should do it i hope duoqueue will get removed no more duo botlaners ultra inting or main enchanters getting boosted by their adc same for the ultra inflating duo jgl mid if both are good at abusing the vocal they can literally solo win every game till diamond as fucking hardstuck gold deleted we really promise we are doing something this time please come back please clap remove duo enable voice coms great game lol it took them years to go from dynamic que for all to lets finally implement solo que riot is such a joke lol better late than never i guess i am really excited at the prospect of moving duos to flex too many player arties sounds like they would try their hands on a v mode if only there were one seriously no clue if these premades would play a similiar to sr balanced v but it was the very first thing to come to my mind please get that literally solo only mode going this works well with solo queue super try hard flex queue being duo and trio queue with no mans then like a clash practice for s ranked teams works because solo queue becomes balanced flex queue becomes valued higher than its current meme status and s should be kept to a seperate mode as well for practising teams if s are kept in the new flex queue it ruins balance once again so seperate queues solo only mode in order to match player intent and provide the healthiest competitive individual queue possible were reevaluating our take on soloduo and exploring a world where solo players play in solo queue and premades play in ranked flex or organized s modes please rito we need this the fact that voice comms still arent a thing in for a team game so based around communication is ridiculous and its holding the entire world back only took them years to admit duos should not be playing with solos theyre getting quicker duo boosted support mains in shambles rn

in the bowl was d also just remember that the verified fan codes are going out by the end of tonight best of luck to everyone had a whole person work group doing the presale tickets lol removed shame that companies dont care enough to prevent botting its not just a riot issue i was so excited to finally have a chance to go to worlds was on seatgeek for x just a minute after awesome riot and ticketmaster failed in every way possible to protect the seats from bots and scalpers and now resellers are listing the tickets from times the actual price i shit you not there is a ticket on seatgeek that has an price point and whats worse is that the exact same thing will happen tomorrow and on thursday because riot has not even acknowledged that this is happening i waited for over hours to get into the queue and then waited minutes to find out that all the tickets were gone only to see not even minutes later that they were already being listed on the scalping websites first time that worlds has been in na for almost years and nobody will be able to go because riot failed to act me and two friends both in queue ten minutes before it started one was listed as under people he got in clicked one seat said sold out showed no more seats other two of us never even got in fun times deleted deleted most major events sell out within minutes of going on sale through st party vendors this isnt a riot problem this is a ticketmaster problem cant wait to pay double the price for resell no luck im so sad min before queue was so i guess not many were sold during the mc presale im really concerned about the next time that i try to get tickets i havent heard of one person who was actually able to get a ticket i was in queue for minutes for it just to say they are all sold out when i got to the front why even make me wait then if they sold out so fast none so far at least i waited through the queue for it to tell me to pick my seats one selection available which were apparently already claimed repeated and it told me the presale ended repeated a few minutes later and got a much smaller queue which took me to the same pick seats screen which still did not work repeating since then tells me its ended but its possible they are releasing more at certain intervals and checking throughout the day could be fruitful update me and other friends got a verified fan code there may be hope i thought having a mastercard would somewhat make it easier to get tickets but nope nope my friends and i sat there minutes before start never got a chance to even see available seats i waited minutes in queue to be redirected to a timer for the next sale date when it finally said it was my turn to choose seats even better i registered for verified fan and just got an email today saying im not getting a code and am waitlisted whats the point of jumping through all the non advertised hoops and mechanics if theres still no chance of landing a ticket my friends and i have been excited for years to go to this worlds together some of us were even flying in from out of state extremely disappointing no luck ive been nonstop joining the queue for hours now i occasionally get in to view available tickets but when i click any of the options displayed it says someone else has bought them hoping to get selected for the verified sale tomorrow super bummed that they are being scalped already i would love to know if even a single human got a ticket and what riot is going to do about it same experience here man nope super bummed just got my verified fan email aaannnndd waitlisted fml this whole worlds ticket thing has been a clown fiesta and riot completely ignores that its happening cause they get their money anyway im not spending for nosebleeds despite my desire to see finals those botters can get bent and lose that money saw some seats open during the mastercard presale but it was playing wacamole with me as i tried to select the seats popping on and off as i hover over them i main ad and consider myself to have high apm i have a group of that signed up for verified user and only so far manage to get selected the rest of us waitlisted really wish riot had a better way to sell tickets to people who actually watch play league i signed up mins before verified fan registration closed and got an access code today feels lucky man seat geek has been showing seats for the past week peoplebots pre selling pre sold tickets before the pre sale lol anyway had a group of three unable to get tickets one person saw the seat selection page got to refresh one or two times before getting booted to the the next presale will be in x time page was in line after joining the queue minutes before it started ended up in after like minutes of waiting and it was all sold out i refreshed the page once and i saw mid level tickets avaiable at a piece and when i clicked to get them it said it was already taken never saw any other tickets pop up for more minutes and gave up doesnt look likely no one at riot cares about fans and people who actually want to watch otherwise they would not have chosen ticketmaster which is known for not having any security against scalping western companies are so dog at customer service its impressive really no luck either i was able to get pass queue but there was only ticket left and it was gone in a sec no luck for me either found a very helpful thread on twitter http theres some good info in there if youre doing the verified fan presale tomorrow waitlisted as well welp i have some extra for oct th because my friend dropped not trying to make a profit i just need to get rid of them so i dont lose money removed i got waitlisted anyone get in i missed the mastercard presale i didnt get verified fan will i still be able to try tomorrow at am pdt or will i need the code tomorrow morning just saw this the whole system is rigged http ticketmaster actually encourages scalpers honestly astonishing that people like you exist i hope you never made fun of football diehards because its you now dogshit nope same boat as all of you got fucked because of scalpers being assholes i wish riot would do something about this but they wont just like how they wont do much about the state of their game didnt get verified sale and was in queue resale is its lit damn i dont follow them on twitter if anybody has a verified fan code they decided they dont want let me know deleted removed what a joke verified presale cheaper to buy a big new tv and watch it on youtube with the homies
2648,t3_yngjww,2022-11-06 04:28:08+00:00,Negative,0.7891208643005008,yngjww,was lil nas supposed to be lux was it all lipsynced expected lil nas x to have the same outfit as prestige edition ksante sadge lol so many people got timed out during lil nass performance i thought the visuals were neat but not really feeling any of the songs from what i gather it apparently sounded pretty good live i cant speak to that fact as i wasnt there onstream it sounded wrong and looked all over the place no way it was planned like that you could barely hear the artists over the superobvious studio playback not sure if we ever even heard the first artist the transitions between songs were weak performers were also outofsync with playback multiple times nd artist played around with his mic the entire time indicating it didnt work again i refuse to believe it was planned like that given what we saw from the team in previous years if executed perfectly it could have been top still not even close to but good with how it turned out its one of the weakest ones we have seen so far hopefully the stream audio was just having some issues and not the actual live audio because edda hayes sounded muted for a good bit before the audio came through she ended up having like lines audible before the song ended i guess worlds will still be the best opening ceremony i mean this was fine fine thats it it wasnt mindblowing riot simply raised the bar in the past years to a point that is now hard to surpass like punch cows bright hardtofind rotten offend offbeat telephone panicky honestly a pretty weak opener all around i felt the segway to the players also didnt feel that natural worlds will still be my favorite everything about that performance for me was amazing this opening just didnt gather as much hype as i want when its truly a david vs goliath story and seeing deft endure so much for whole years to finally get to his goal was just beautiful great performers shame about the lipyncing tho i feel like they got scared after the whole rise fiasco lol the year fpx won everyone lipsynced too i love that censored anthem s i will take a mediocre opening ceremony for a banger series every single time live i heard it was great but in the theater it was pretty poor lip sycing was one part that was super obvious but the amount of camera cutting was too much imo i was ready to post this to discords to hype league up but after watching it live i am too embarassed to do that paris still stands as the best one ever but this was pretty great too the stage effects were fantastic one thing i noticed was that lilnasxs dancers were on another level from the rest lol deleted minutes of poorly lip synched music after the announced start time was certainly not the move for me they spent so much money on this opener and would have gotten much better value and a less pissed off audience if they werent so masturbatory about it we started drafting minutes after start time why i actually enjoyed it and still better the sync was horrible if you cant perform live without autotune yeah just dont going by the comments guess im the only one who thought it was pretty dope second best one behind all im saying is the storyline for this worlds should give riot a lot of inspiration for a hype song and accompanying music video which hopefully translates into a hype worlds opening ceremony the only thing i remember thinking during these minutes is oh crop tops are still in in usa dude lil nas x outfit was so bad im a fan of lil nas but damn bruh he look liked he just came from a low budget dress up show or something i just want to say the past worlds ceremonies were so much better just go back and have a look at the camera work is better the choreography of the dancers the holograms and everything there really tbh it was kinda mid as a live audience member it was a bit of a vfx shitshow with them resorting to clear panels to try and superimpose the vfx version in sf it didnt really work it was best when they utilized the monitor they put under the stage shit ceremony i was surprised to see empty seats in the crowd during each shot and i thought they would of sold the entire arena and not just the lower half why they had the upper decks blacked out as nothing above the suits was open this was very bad why were they lip syncing and damn his costume is so bad lmao i lowkey thought he was a minion i kept thinking that it was kinda sad that the otherwise great performances by the dancers was totally overshadowed by the fact that it was just one sales pitch for a skin line and lacked context not even going to talk about lil nas performance no hype for me god that ceremony was awful i hated the lil nas x part im just gonna come right out and say it this was really the worst worlds song weve ever had whos bright idea was it to adopt an anthem that talks about im glad my daddy didnt wear a condom and honestly all the lil nas content about him being the president of league was super cringe i dont know whos idea it was to bring this guy on and parade him around like hes everyones favorite superstar but i personally wasnt impressed and thought it was pretty bad overall glad worlds is over so i dont have to hear it anymore banger until lil nas x took the stage what was with the random magical girl cosplay if the intent was for it to be prestige empyrean ksantes outfit then it didnt look similar at all huge whiplash from the previous performance like i said watching it live complete antithesis of hype even more so when its am imagine you have this once in a life opportunity to be remembered as the best artist to perform on worlds stage so you decide to go full playback lipsync with anime girl cosplay on you in which you look like a total shit xd lamest opening ever sadly nobodys gonna mention the fact they threw a random mastercard logo on the floor screens in the middle of the performance i get you need sponsors but jfc stop shoving them in literally every corner of the screen and all the way into artistic performances we aint in cyberpunk just yet if its wasnt for the games that followed this would easily be the worst worlds riot has done to date thank god the series was such a banger completely forgot about the worst worlds opening ever was it good it was great although i felt like we at home missed of it due to the cameras shots and angles i think was the best by far but im biased as i was there by far one of the weakest ceremonies so far bring me back to pheonix rise i reminded of a quote from some commentator if the music is going to be bad just dont have it it does the opposite of build hype and makes people not care about the event this was in response the tongue lady for one of the na finals opening ceremonies that was honestly pretty weak i see they tried to replicate success but not even getting all singers of the s song on stage and instead have bunch of people dancing was pretty cringe the empyeran was whatever and lil nas kind of salvaged it in the end but lip sync tradition buried it all that was pretty bad tbh yeah effects were nice it was pretty much expected since its na and riot wouldnt miss a chance to throw a ton of money at their home region but the performances were pretty bad out of the three the first one was the least bad at least it was a league song and we had kaisa i guess the second performance idk what it was it might as well have been some random performance at some random event nothing related to league at all then yeah lil nas appeared and me and my friends were like wtf and we just couldnt focus on the ceremony anymore i understand everyone has a freedom to express themselves as they want but this was way too distracting made the ceremony nonserious anymore anyway then we got a further confirmation that starwalking just isnt a hype song the performance was a sludge tbh then it ended and we were all like thats it i was like sure riot would love to top the europe performance guess i was wrong or money cant buy everything can we just bring back imagine dragon they actually hyped the crowd and the performance was when i was watching this opening ceremony i was tempted to just turn off the stream since it did bored me more than anything else i think riot still doesnt know what people like i have never seen a worlds pre show that could be so perfekt and ending up so medioker kai sa showed us we could have gotteb something massive riot seems to forget they are about league here not random semi pop star concert promotion bah owell the chinese usualy knows how todo it lame sucked did anyone actually expect a banger ceremony the guy literally used league of legends to promote himself got a champion basically designed after him bad song wasnt even made for worlds it was already written beforehand just an overall l this year im just glad drx won im curious if people still think the song was boring because of the clip not even a little hyped because of the song luckly the games were bangers please bring back live singing performance was not that bad you can debate that it was even better than and pale in comparison to those openings that wig lookin dumb asf cringe asf ngl in korea and china the opening ceremonies they actually care about the game and the spirit of league of legends and you can see that in the effort they put into the performance and the spectacle of it in the us its just what are we selling this year and how are we going to promote it i think the performers did well but even with that the show still sucked because there was nothing to it very visually appealing presentation dont care about the lip singing because i was not expecting much honestly it was so cringe the opening ceremony was still the best for me the drums into imagine dragons was just so good and no strange dance performance or whatever i got so mad i didnt even wanted to see the ganes after that performance my god hnnnnnnnnnng cringe i find it so narcissistic that lil nas had to put himself up and in the center so many production experts in this thread as someone who was at the performance i thought it was excellent the visuals the sound the creativity it really felt special some of that might be the effect of being there live but i also watched it when i got home to see how it translated to video kudos to all involved in the production i thoroughly enjoyed it i thought it did a great job highlighting a match we knew would be historic reddit and twitch chat try not to be homophobic impossible challenge still blows my mind they didnt change the censored line or just let him sing it casters can say wtf but nas cant say condom hated kaisa otherwise fine why was kaisa here thought the interpretive dancing in the first section was the lamest imo last years opening ceremony was the absolute peak and i really hoped that they would keep at least a part of this years show prerecorded it felt weird having to go back to those live shows where the audio and hologram stuff is always kinda crappy for livestream viewers while we essentially got full blown k music videos performed in incredibly detailed custommade sets last year i get that all that extra expense was also part of arcanes marketing campaign but keeping at least some of that production value wouldve been cool but its good to hear that the people who paid for a ticket and got to see everything in person had a better experience it was fine to be honest first and last songs gave some hype due to being somehow iconic for series though long waiting for opening made it feel like slog and i couldnt wait till i finally see game being played lip desynch average animations and some questionable choreography werent good thing but overall it felt alright lil nass costume was a little big questionable too though music and his expression on scene made it not necessarily as important as twitch comments seemed to hot takes i hate that we can feel the opacity of the screens i feel like we shouldnt be able to say there are screens that make the hologram effect but it was visible i dont really like rap or lil nas x didnt enjoy the second song but jackson wangs scenechoreography was cool but the effects are worse and worse every year kda was insane legends never die was insane i had felt like they were real back then riot got scared to let his performers sing live after that rise butchering lmao was lil nas supposed to be rick james probably the best opening ever glued to my tv the whole time it was pretty awful theses shows are always incredible i went to the worlds in la when zedd preformed and it was incredible yeah i guess i didnt miss anything those type of shows are not for me but nice light effects whoever was in charge of the camera really should have stayed as far away from faces as possible maybe it was good live but on stream it was hilariously bad with looking like i was watching an old dubbed godzilla movie cause that lip syncing forgot about the syncing part this was pure fucking pain his performance was like the worst xd lowest quality one remains still the best opening ceremony well that was rather underwhelming weak and all over sloppy did not feel like a worlds performance at all picked some of the most unhype songs to open with too honestly so disappointed by the playback was that just the mastercard logo on the ground like half way into the ceremony fuck that opening was insane the performance and effects were absolute next level too bad it was lip sync
