Any good you see in a store will have an audience that people are willing to buy at a higher price

But scalping doesn’t set the price at the “real” market price. 

What scalping does is increase the price as high as possible, then slowly lower it, selling the product to the highest price each consumer is willing to pay.

In equilibrium, while there will still be some people who get priced out, there are many who are paying less than what they would be willing to pay. But at the same time no reason for the price to change because the supply matches the demand

However with scalpers, every single consumer basically is paying the highest price they are willing to pay. The price is set to insane amounts so the rich whales buy first then, after that audience has been finished with its lowered a bit for the dolphins, etc etc.

In addition, for the people who are not paying the very highest premium, they have to wait long periods for the price to drop to a reasonable one which means the product is less available",2025-09-30 15:34:22+00:00,9

Demand and offer model assumes every customer has an equal chance to the product. Scalpers are reducing ticket's availability and forcing people to pay at a higher price than they would be willing to buy in order to profit. This can be seen by last year's worlds where a lot of matches had empty stands. A lot of people would have bought the ticket at Riot's price, but no one was willing to buy them at the scalper's price. 




You could sell them at the perfect price and scalpers would still profit off of FOMO and a lot of other things that the market theory doesn't take into account.

183,1nudrkt,nh3kqua,Sav10r,t1_nh3e3mf,"There's multiple issues with this. 

First, I'm not even sure what you mean by ""highest price possible"". If you are saying ""Let's have organizers sell $50 tickets for an initial starting price of 1 Million dollars"" that's also stupid. Mostly because now you are punishing legitimate customers who did get their tickets without scalping. Why should they get punished? Just because a lot of tickets can get scalped doesn't mean ALL of them will.

If you mean ""highest price possible"" as a hypothetical ""price people would buy scalped at"" that also doesn't work because there is no way to determine that accurately so far in advance. Scalpers will usually over charge by crazy amounts on the day the tickets went on sale. As time goes on and the date gets closer and closer towards the event, the scalpers are forced to lower their prices until the day of the event itself where things settle at the lowest possible rates. There's no way you could possibly predict what the correct number to price the tickets at so far in advance. Also, once again, you are punishing legitimate buyers all in the name of a crusade against Scalpers.

Finally, your idea also doesn't factor in human psychology. If the initial sale price of a ticket is $50, just about no one is shelling out $200 for the scalped version. But if the organizers started with an initial sale price of $200, some people would be willing to buy the scalped version at $250 because the percentage mark up isn't as crazy marking up $50 tickets as $200. 

It's not like organizers can just come out and literally tell everyone, ""Hey everyone... These tickets were initially be priced at $50, but in our crusade against scalpers, all of these tickets will now sell at $200 just so they make less profit."" If they did, everyone (normal buyers and scalpers) would be outraged and they might as well cancel having an audience at the event.",2025-09-30 23:47:27+00:00,5

188,1nudrkt,nh5oryj,Rafoel,t1_nh3kqua,"Ultimately, he is right.

When situation like this happens, the root issue is that original ticket price doesn't match the demand (so amount of people willing to pay the original price is much much much higher than the total amount of tickets).

The scalpers never manage to resell all the tickets they bought, but they do not care - if the price difference is high enough, they rake in huge profits anyway.

If they are able to sell for 10x the original price, they only need to resell over 10% of the tickets they bought to make profit.

On the other hand, if they were able to sell for only 2x the original price, they would need to resell over 50% of the tickets to make profit.

This massively increases risk for scalpers as well. Acts as huge deterrent.

All in all, for reasons I don't understand, organizers in such events very often set the price of tickets absurdly too low. And then they complain about the events not bring money... like what?

One possible explanation is that the scalpers business is actually in cahoots with the organizers, if that's the case they are able to pocket the money.",2025-10-01 09:34:08+00:00,1

Edit: put the letter on the forums year ago apologizing to the community and developers for being toxic and having a bad attitude.... obviously a good idea.

There is a transcendent quality to a character that is loyal to its identity, but to drag that character down as a mascot for a worldly endeavor would make it lose that timeless quality.

Bill Watterson had it right when he refused to license Calvin and Hobbes and cash in on the merchandising.  It would have destroyed the characters and they would have lost their timeless quality.  This is why everyone loves Calvin and Hobbes STILL bc they are free of worldly affects, and no one gives a crap about Garfield which is tied down by mammon (dolls, shirts, movie deals).",2018-10-26 17:23:05+00:00,2

Basically any/all free apps/services would become paid subscriptions. Reddit, twitter, YouTube, Facebook, etc etc


The average consumer has so much entertainment/services that are free or subsidized in exchanged for what is typically a minor inconvenience.

Then you get 1,000 when you deposit $20 for the first time, and **10,000** when you direct deposit $20 into it. Then you get 100 RP for your first 10 purchases on it.

That was a mind-blowing amount of RP literally for free. I was super-happy with that promotion and I wish they would've done something like that again.

* Offer a sign up bonus where you spend $1000 in a few months and get $250 worth of RP. (some issues offer $100 back for $500 spend in three months so you have to make the RP value worth the spend or else you'd just settle for cash back)",2018-09-18 22:20:14+00:00,0

They partnered for a Serve card, meaning it was an option for a lot of students who might not have qualified for credit, but the flipside reality is that Serve, like any other debit-based financial product, just can't offer rewards on par with a credit card because of the low fixed-rate interchange. Anyone who could afford even a basic rewards credit card was better off just using that and buying RP with their cashback. Even a straight 1RP/$ arrangement (which is what I suspect any co-branded credit card deal would look like) would be a hard sell compared to just buying RP outright. Maybe the arrangement would be something more like earning points which can be redeemed for an amount of RP once you save a certain amount, like some cashback rewards cards require for redemption.

* Performers were also out-of-sync with playback multiple times
* 2nd artist played around with his mic the entire time indicating it didn't work


Again i refuse to believe it was planned like that given what we saw from the team in previous years. If executed perfectly, it could have been top3. Still not even close to 2019 but good. With how it turned out, its one of the weakest ones we have seen so far.",2022-11-06 10:42:28+00:00,82

But the performances were pretty bad. Out of the three, the first one was the least ""bad"",  at least it was a League song and we had Kai'sa I guess... the second performance IDK what it was, it might as well have been some random performance at some random event, nothing related to League at all.

Then yeah, Lil Nas appeared and me and my friends were like ""wtf?"" and we just couldn't focus on the ceremony anymore. I understand everyone has a freedom to express themselves as they want, but this was way... too distracting? Made the ceremony non-serious anymore. Anyway, then we got a further confirmation that Starwalking just isn't a hype song, the performance was a sludge tbh.

Then it ended. And we were all like ""that's it?"". I was like 99% sure Riot would LOVE to top the 2019 Europe performance. Guess I was wrong. Or money can't buy everything.",2022-11-06 11:59:46+00:00,6

Out of all of the artist mentioned previously (Drake, Lil Nas X, Lil Baby) , Drake is probably the most ""known"", and even then it's super niche.

No, that's not it, you are missing the point, but hey, why keep arguing over random stuff with just anecdotical evidence, when we can just prove you wrong.

Here's actual data.

https://chartmasters.org/2019/01/drakes-global-heatmap/

Or check his album selling data which pretty much restates the same, Drake is big in North America and not so much everywhere else (except a few exceptions where he does ""well"", which may very well include Ireland, which was the point I was making towards you, that even if it's true, it means shit, since we are talking worldwide)

So, yeah, you are mistaken, hell,  maybe right at the same time and Drake is huge in Ireland (don't know, and don't really care tbh, since that wasn't the topic at hand)

I hardly play Ranked because it frustrates me. Every now and then I feel like I can climb and I'm better than the rank I'm currently at, but after a couple of games and unnecessary losses (either because of me or because or my teammates), I get frustrated/tilted.

That **is** how language works, sorry. You may not like it but you have absolutely nothing backing up your argument.

Even if we are being pedantic about it like you want to be:
The US is often referred to simply as America, thus they are American.

North America is basically never referred to as America. And in the case of locations with 2 parts the first part is always included, so for example North Korea citizens are North Koreans and South Koreans are South Korean. New Zealanders are New Zealander and not just Zealander.

But their balancing team is still garbage. It has been confirmed multiple times by Riot themselves that they aren't balancing the game but are instead just buffing and nerfing champions in and out of the spotlight to force meta changes and what not. Even recently I saw a Rioter confirm that the hope of Pyke's changes (pretty sure it was Pyke) currently on PBE was to make him picked more in pro play, when he is already a top tier pick when Alistar and Braum are not in the game. And you know what Riot said when they nerfed Sejuani when she was top tier? It wasn't ""she was too strong"" or anything like that. It was ""she has had enough time in the spotlight"".

For a player like me who couldn't care less about pro play, it feels terrible to have champions you play just buffed into viability just to have them gutted to a worse spot than they were in before because Riot decided their time was over.

Not to mention the balance team is really stubborn when it comes to things not working out how they imagined they would. No ADC builds the new Stormrazor because it's pushing their powerspike behind? Buff it until the point it becomes a must buy on every ADC! Last patch's Kassadin buffs were really bad and pushed Kassadin into S+ tier status?

This may not be the most fruitful place for this discussion, but to me this brings up an important point with the longevity of games.... In order for games to live this long, they actually *shouldn't* be expecting *you* to be playing in 20 years, they should be expecting new blood.

I think COD has taken a different approach here, but I think things like WoW have stood the test of time for this reason. Blizzard is *not* trying to keep their original player base still playing WoW, it's a very different game now targeting much more casual players. It was originally targeting the super hardcore gamer but that's no longer the case, they've actually moved into a much different market and my friends who play wow today are much different than my friends who I played vanilla and TBC with.

If League wants to stay alive for another ten or twenty years, they need to do something to find new players. It's unrealistic to expect someone to continue playing the same game for 20+ years. So they need to either A) drastically change the game to keep it fresh B) target a new audience or C) keep targeting an age group even as people grow out of it and new ones grow into it. 

So far they've mostly gone with ""keep it fresh"" but that'll run out of runway eventually.

Traditional sports tend to aim more towards the C approach (though players vs viewers work a little different and have different demographics). I think a game that can take this approach is much more likely to become stable and stand the test of time, even if I'm not the one supporting it in 20 years.",2018-09-19 20:08:16+00:00,13

But I don't really imagine it lasting 10 more years. League has hit it's peak long long ago when Riot had absolutely 0 competitors for playerbase counts, so they never bothered with properly growing the playerbase, never bothered with properly getting new players into the game, etc. And now that there are other big games out right now with huge playerbases like Fortnite, Riot is trying to get off their butt and desperately attract new players with ads and a new tutorial, 8 years overdue and way too late. Everybody has already played League of Legends right now, even if they didn't and liked it the new player experience is still horrible and the grind for champions is unreal. So when people move on from the game eventually, nobody is going to come replace them.

&#x200B;

Overall LoL will end up with a dedicated playerbase like many other games. However the question is can Riot manage League with less income from less players?

There's just no reason for LoL to ever fade away, in the West or otherwise. As long as there's no serious competitor there will continue to be people interested in MOBA's. And if LoL has modern graphics and features - why would the interest in it ever fade?

You stop following League few months and the game's changed and you need to relearn the new champions, the new reworks, the new items that changed all the matchups, etc, etc.

I play since 8 years and the fact that League keeps changing over and over is one of the reasons I am quitting this game.

I have no time to keep up with those changes, nor will.

LoL has another drawback: way too many champions in this game. You'd need hundreds and hundreds of games just to **see** all of the champions, let alone understand them.

Whether or not it's hardcore today could be argued until the cows come home, but the point is with _a lot_ of the changes they made from LFG/LFD/LFR, the way the item systems work recently, slut mog, achievements, etc, they've definitely toned it down and brought a new audience to the game.",2018-09-19 23:34:37+00:00,3

Less cartoony and at least a touch of photorealism that shows that it’s 2018 not 2008. Now, I understand it wouldn’t be easy and it’s been quite clearly shown from Fortnite and Cuphead cartoony graphics aren’t bad and the newest photorealistic graphics aren’t the only way to do well.

Its why your debit card has a monthly fee that goes up if you have more transactions, your bank has to pay for them. And its also why they wave the fee if you hold a minimum balance, because if you hold that balance, they make more than enough money on average through their investments to compensate for it.

Long story short, cash is king. Pay with your dam credit card so you dont clog the line. And for god sake, dont leave your money in the bank and invest it with a real broker group that sells genuinely good products. They exist and are not hard to find, and can be far safer if you google what they recommend you put your money into.

My sapphire reserve nets me between 7-8k points a month on cash return that is 70-80 dollars a month cash back and more if I redeem for travel. 
Now let's say the theoretical rp card gave the same returns as cash value in RP. This benefits the credit card company far more as you can never maximize your value. For one with the way RP works you will always have some left over that you will never use it's why riot sells the points in whole numbers that end in zero and only sells it's in game goods for any other number this gives them small gains in value overtime every time you purchase rp. Likely a card that offers rp as a reward would follow a structure similar in that you can only redeem for specific amounts of rp as this would go along the same guidelines as what they already do. 
Also most reward cards that offer decent returns or perks come with a annual fee. Even if it's a low end fee like 35 dollars you would have to spend 3500 dollars just to break even with the annual fee and only after that would you actually be gaining anything 
The biggest reason why this is a financial no go is you will eventually not want to spend money on league and will have a open credit line that is either useless and has a annual fee you must pay or something you use with no intent to redeem the rewards. ",2018-11-22 19:58:32+00:00,1

I highly doubt that anybody would pay an AF for a card that just gives you RP(unless the travel+LoL audience exists, which i doubt). The majority of rewards cards doesn't charge an AF either, with the ones that do charge an AF generally having significantly better rewards. I don't really think the CSR is really comparable in this situation, for the $450 AF you are getting much better return on spend on travel and dining than almost every other card on the market assuming you redeem for travel.

""WP has an intuitive meaning

75% WP for team X is easy to understand without added context

+3k GD requires additional context to gauge [sic] it’s impact (see below)
WP doesn’t change based on the game time

40% WP at 14 minutes has the same meaning as WP at 25 minutes

3K GD at 14 minutes and 3K GD at 25 minutes have different impacts; only those with deep LoL knowledge can correctly interpret that impact""

This part I don't like, obligatory snarky it's not it's, but also most league players even without deep knowledge knows what gold diff at a given time means, although I do think watching a game *without* seeing gold diff and guessing the gold diff is a real skill. But yeah it's not hard to interpret 3k GD at 14 vs 25, whereas it's really really hard to interpret their win percentage metric, because all it tells you is the black box thinks a team has a 40% chance to win; you have to guess why it thinks that. 

On the other hand, I do like the idea of trying to figure out which events in game affect winning chances, since especially before the dragon nerfs but even still dragons feel undervalued to me by many players who are ok giving it up or trading for herald when to me that usually feels losing. When they write ""To take this a step further, we could potentially explore Win Probability Added (WPA)"" that sounds like they're on the right track.

But it's weird to me that they say ""WP models aren’t meant to predict which team will win at any given point in time. WP is meant to reflect the relative changes in game-state based on previous performances."" How can it reflect changes if it doesn't predict accurately? You can't tell the impact a certain event has if the win prediction isn't accurate.

I'm curious if it's more or less accurate than some simple linear model using only a few important factors out of their list, particularly gold/xp/dragons.

edit ^ this would be interesting to check and much easier to check if they also released the gold, dragons, inhibs, etc., that they use, that would dispose me much more favorably towards aws than just providing their win percent, but idk if they released those anywhere or not",2023-10-29 13:57:04+00:00,23

However the idea itself isn't completely bad, but they would have to implement it differently. Let's say 20 minutes in both teams are even in gold/kills/drakes etc, but one team has an early game comp while the other has a late game comp. Obviously the game state is even and by the metrics used this would be a 50% win probability for each team, but anyone who knows about the game would tell you the scaling late game comp is massively favoured to win the game from this gamestate. If they were able to somehow show how much of an advantage the scaling comp has based on how good they scale etc then it would be a good addition that would actually add something to the viewer experience. but as it is it doesn't really add anything.",2023-10-29 12:06:22+00:00,10

What is the difference between 5k lead at 15min vs 40min? Someone experience will know, but not a newcomer.

Now add the dragons, the soul, the turrets, where the gold is, and so on. It may be a lot to process.
I will always remember when I got into lol. I was watching games with 10kills against 3, and then the team would lose. Most of the times to Koreans, and I would not understand. I always thought we were winning hard. But the Koreans played differently.  They did lane swap to get earlier turrets for instance, and thus would get way more gold and map control.

I took data analytics courses and we have a course that specializes in sports analytics. My prof brought up data collection method for hokey player and mention that most analytics came out days or weeks after, so I asked if it’s possible that perhaps some teams may have some sort bleeding edge tech to do analytic in real time, which may give them a massive advantage for mid-match decision making. 

The answer was no, at least to his knowledge. He is certain however, that upscale firm offer post night analysis (as, you have a match this evening and the data analysis will be up by next morning) for professional teams during major event. This is already extremely fast and apparently comes with big pay check. Lesser team usually waits weeks if not more for their analysis result. 

Now since League of Legend is a video game, so data collection should be a lot easier. But considering how much money traditional sports are collectively investing in data science and they STILL couldn’t manage to have a affordable approach to precise real time analysis, I very much doubt AWS have some giga secret tech that allows them to give good real time prediction.

2. It needs to learn that only in very specific situations is there a 99% winrate and that they need to give like 5-10% leeway for teams making mistakes in most situations. A ""certain win"" as the AI currently sees it should be around 90-95% instead of it showing 99-100%.

To make it better, you need even more. What builds is everyone going. How close are people to their power spikes. 

Even more, how does each champion function into this team comp. An extreme example would be a master yi into an army of cc, or an adc that has no good peel into a team that entirely outranges or can engage from out of range. Usually pro comps aren’t that skewed, but in almost every game one person is set up to have a bad time. 

I think overall, this task is too hard and there’s a billion things that you could never get quite right. None of it even takes in to account who the player is and how they’re performing that day.

for league its pretty simple: gold lead = ahead. like even the most early game draft vs the most scaling shit, you would only allot up to 5k deficit to call a team ahead at lets say, the 30 minute mark.

in dota, there are positions. this means that gold leads dont necessarily reflect the ""correct"" gold distribution. i guess in league you can say you would rather have a adc thats 3k ahead and a top thats 4k behind than be on the other team. its something like that but to a greater extent.

and then theres the actual big dealbreaker which is the inevitability of scaling. its much much more obvious in dota. you can literally be behind 10k team gold and ahead at the 30 minute mark.

also, to ramble on a bit more, the concept of taking turns in dota is also more ingrained, where a team would initiate a 'turn' (the attempt to make a play) with an item called smoke which bypasses ward vision.

why this is important to win probability is because it creates more anticipation for the losing team to make a play (what can the losing team find from making a play), or to resist an opponent's turn (playing defensively and cutting losses).

There is a reason why chess evaluation bars never show ""probabilities""(they only show evaluations such as +4.0, -3.0, M7) and do not present themselves as win probabilities. Probabilities, by definition, describe how likely something is to occur and are thus  more suited to talk about things which have some element of randomness to them (such as human error/execution). No deterministic algorithm can know whether or not a player will accidentally flash at any given moment or simply miss their skill shot.

Second, there are methods to understand how the model decides an outcome. A common one is to generate fictional data that varies slightly from the existing one : if I give 1000 more gold to one team, how much does it changes the prediction ? This method allows you to infer how each variable weighs in the final prediction, and how much. You can then provide your client (or here, the watchers) with a general understanding of the model sufficient to influence it's decisions, and when the model is trustworthy enough, a way to work towards a desired outcome. 

As a data scientist, I feel it's lazy (for someone in the field) to refer to them as black boxes because they're really not, and a lot of value is added by looking under the hood and understanding the decision process.

That said, it's possible some evaluation models have switched to neural networks, but I'm 99% sure that for example stockfish (the best known chess evaluation tool) uses Minimax with pruning.

For anyone interested, here's some differences between MiniMax and a regression model:

MiniMax is a state search algorithm specifically made for 2 player games. It works by looking at the possible moves from the current state, evaluating those and then choosing ones that would maximize each player's value. Basically, on player A's turn, it tries to maximize the value number and on player B's turn it tries to minimize it (that's why it's called a MiniMax). A positive total value number means player A is winning, a negative means player B is winning. It takes the current state, looks at the next possible states (given by the possible moves player A can make) and chooses the move that would give the most value to player A. That's if you use a MiniMax with depth 1. If you use a higher depth number, then it would also look at all the NEXT possible moves (now player B's turn) and decide the best move by the total end result. That's also why StockFish has a ""depth"" parameter. It's all very interesting stuff. All alpha beta pruning does is make the algo more efficient by discarding some states that will never be better.

A regression model is used for predictive statistical analysis. It has some inputs, weights to each input and it gives you an output based on those. It needs to be trained from existing data, the weights are what's changed in training. It's also possible they used a neural network, which works similarly, alebit a bit more complex.",2023-10-29 15:30:56+00:00,0

They all predict the distribution of 1 step into the future. Contrary to what you stated, these are implicitly probability models since you could recursively predict time series paths (predict the next step, then, using historical data + previously generated step, predict the next step) through a ton of Monte Carlo simulation, and obtain the implied probability through dividing the number of paths that end in victory and end in defeat.

Also fyi none of these models just “predict” what the next step is. What they instead do is predict the probability density function (parametric or otherwise) of what the value of the next time step. That is to say, it will estimate the probability of the next step being any particular value. How is this not a probabilistic model on this account alone?",2023-10-29 20:20:13+00:00,4

My personal opinion is that azure will very slowly (over next 20 years or so) usurp AWS, because Microsoft can very easily bundle Azure with their current b2b product offerings, while AWS will never have that kind of pricing leverage.

They are not used in the same circonstances but serve the same purpose.

I would not be surprised that the person or team who trained the model had little to no interaction with the players/casters to make sense of the data they get, or that the data provided was in 20 different CSV files for a grand total of 100 games usable at the end.

From a matchmaking standpoint it is clearly better, it will provide way better matches and a better experience for those playing solo.

BUT, this is a video game, and one of the major draws is to play Duos with your friend and for that to mean something. You’re progressing the same ladder you normally do solo, but with a buddy. It does hurt the competitive integrity of ladder, but it is also a major driving force for a lot of people to play at all. Yes duos can just play flex and it might make flex more popular, but the fact that it’s a separate rank, makes people look down on flex, it’s a lesser mode. If they can’t influence their “real” rank playing with their friend, they’re just going to go to another game where they can.

Maybe there’s a way to give a “strict solo” option like in Dota? But even there, the non-strict solo, feels like a crapshoot, I feel like players would just only ever use it, and playing duos would be way worse than they are currently.",2022-03-04 19:56:42+00:00,345

You’re progressing the same ladder you normally do solo, but with a buddy. It does hurt the competitive integrity of ladder, but it is also a major driving force for a lot of people to play at all. Yes duos can just play flex and it might make flex more popular, but the fact that it’s a separate rank, makes people look down on flex, it’s a lesser mode. If they can’t influence their “real” rank playing with their friend, they’re just going to go to another game where they can.
>

This, 100%. I rarely ever solo queue nowadays because of how cancerous/bad the game can be. It's much more enjoyable to get fucked by imbalance and unfun mechanics with a buddy.


On a real note though this is legit the only reason I play ranked anymore. It's much more fun/enjoyable with a buddy simply because I feel like we can have a bigger impact on the game than if we were to be playing solo, especially as a support main. It's also a ""team"" game, so forcing you to cooperate with randoms vs having someone you're comfortable playing with seems very counterintuitive to this definition/classification of the game. 

And as for the flex thing that is also completely true; nobody gives a shit about their flex rank (including me). 9/10 times if we have 3 people hanging out in discord 2 of us will go off and duo and the other will solo/play another game because ""if we're gonna spend time playing ranked it's gonna be real ranked"". My friends all have this same mentality and I think most league players do too. If they remove duo queue there's a 95% chance I'm never playing ranked with my friends again, which fucking blows.

No point in tryharding in a queue where players are almost always mismatched. 

However this really has no good solution. You can’t make them share the same rank or one queue becomes useless, and you can’t remove partying or else that’ll also make the queue useless.

5073,t6qbc9,hzdhqyn,,t1_hzd2lw5,"I strongly agree. I think one of the biggest issue has is that it is effectively 2 games. There is “competitive” with coordinated teams, strategies and all the bells and whistles that go along with it. Then there is soloQ which is try to get yourself so fed you can overcome 4 apes and 1 v 9 your way to victory. 

Soloq is well supported but competitive is not supported at all outside of clash. I think if you made a ladder version of clash and actually gave it unique rewards (it’s own victorious skin, something like banners before they became a participation award, etc.) it would be very popular. It needs to have its own unique rewards that need to be at a minimum as rewarding as soloq but in a perfect world more rewarding. 

Organizing a 5 man team is obviously a lot more effort than pressing the Queue button. That effort needs to be rewarded in order for 5 man teams to be a thing. This is why the previous attempt failed. The fact that most players choose the path of least resistance if rewards are the same has been proven over and over again in virtually every video game in existence. A competitive 5 man ladder would be successful if it was supported and offered rewards to match the effort required.",2022-03-04 22:14:23+00:00,14

People do treat causal game modes (especially ARAM) less seriously than competitive game modes.

The reason Solo is seen to be better to flex is because at best, you have control of 2 of the 5 members in your game. 

 Is your flex rank your actual rank where you contributed equally? Or is it a product of 2 diamonds smashing their lanes then beating everyone else? Who knows?

Why did BLG’s summer end poorly? The lost 3-2 to LNG, right?
And it was a close series. I don’t think they played badly at all.

I am fine with everyone rating GenG above BLG for this tournament, I did too.

But I wouldn’t call a 40% win chance (so in my head it was 60% GenG and 40% BLG) a choke, that happens 4 out of 10 times.
And I think we gotta say, GenG mental is clearly mich worse than I thought even though we knew that already coming in.

I agree GenG was the favourite, but I don’t think it’s a choke to lose to a team extremely close to you. At worst, BLG was the 5th best team in the play-offs and GenG 2nd best. I think that’s fine, honestly.",2023-11-03 17:41:23+00:00,5

Peanut stops his recall after destroying mid tier 1 and allows BLG to continue pushing to inhib which leads to Chovy's terrible TP trying to defend the turret.

Some of it is mistakes, but a lot of it is just the strategies they favor. He looks worse than he deserves to most of the time but he’s so good as a teamfighter that it’s worth it.

Beyond that, he had to play with different supports through the regular season and zeyzal also doesn’t happen to be a hyper aggressive laner (although you have to credit this man’s composure as a rookie, absolutely cool under pressure and very calm about the vision game and mid to late teamfighting)",2018-10-11 15:39:13+00:00,10

I think the west would benefit from that when going to worlds and MSI etc.

I feel like as soon as they got the C9 monkey off their back, TSM completely changed their outlook.

That makes Galio a super good engage tool, but Jensen definitely could've played it more as a defensive/denial pick and just saved Sven when he got caught etc.

Maybe I'm wrong though, I'm just a reddit analyst. Or maybe Reapered will agree and give him a stern talking-to.

All it takes is one little jimmy out of thousands to sneek into moms purse and type out her credit card info. And now days its so easy to buy shit on online and not give any personal info. Even on amazon all you need to do is buy some stuff and have it sent to a pick up location. Slap on the one/same day shipping, walk in with a legit looking id and you just purchased god knows what one someone elses card with basically no chance of getting cought. Or if you can find someone dumb enough to sell to you could use the credit card to purchase bitcoins, which is like a wet dream for credit card scammer. ",2018-10-27 17:10:32+00:00,1
