0,1nudrkt,darkbluedarz,Worlds Tickets got scalped within moments of tickets going live. (Even with Mastercard),2025-09-30 13:51:15+00:00,895,"I am furious.

I emailed Riot a week ago, explaining that we have a China Expat Community that ran into issues buying tickets for MSI and previous LoL events. ***No Reply***

Tickets for the Semi-Finals & Finals went on pre-sale this morning for only those who have a Mastercard.

***And they're gone...***

Our group has tried all morning for an hour straight to get a ticket, and they got botted and are already on ***re-selling sites at x10 price***. Riot will say its linked to your passport, which does not matter in China. They don't care at the door of the event.

If you're thinking about flying to Shanghai for the event, don't bother. As an international visitor, you won't get a ticket. Shameful from Riot.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000002248047C5C0>
1,9rjf0i,Angry_Hotel_Customer,Riot and Mastercard gifted me 10k RP and a TF skin for my Mastercard Twisted Fate skin idea,2018-10-26 10:04:39+00:00,13365,"Link with proof: https://imgur.com/gallery/bMZxEtP


Not too long after I posted my original ""Mastercard Twisted Fate skin idea"" where I talked about the new partnership between them and Riot and proposed an amusing way of bringing the fans on board, I got a message from u/RiotStags followed by an email from a Mastercard representative saying they wanted to gift me 10k RP and a TF skin.
Well today I received them I guess this means I've peaked. But also Mastercard are the sponsor of sponsors because I haven't heard of something like this happening before with League and sponsorships to regular fans.
I did not expect anything like this to happen when I originally posted (obviously) but this is such a welcome surprise and I'm really grateful and appreciative of both Riot and Mastercard for making this happen. It's the personal touches like these that make a good company in my opinion, connecting with their customers like this and giving back.

Thank mr. Mastercard

Although a lot of people may say that the jingle is very loud or jarring, I think for what it is and what it means to do, it accomplishes the goal pretty well. 

First item completions are pretty powerful, and I usually always forget to track these things myself as I get too absorbed into the game. 

The Mastercard jingle is pretty distinct enough to break my attention and bring my attention to whichever lane (usually jungle) had just gotten their item complete.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0000022457DE9940>

9,9kzglw,Angry_Hotel_Customer,MasterCard Twisted Fate skin idea,2018-10-03 09:01:34+00:00,3333,"Since league has decided to bring in more sponsors in the broadcast etc. I figured the best way players would accept this is with a skin. Here are my ideas on how such a skin would work with an ability rundown.



Passive - Loaded bank account: upon killing a unit, a MasterCard logo pops up and rewards him with anywhere between 1 and 6 bonus gold to his MasterCard account. Also instead of gold to spend at the shop he uses credit. (obviously)



Q - Wild Cards: MasterCard Twisted Fate throws three cards (bronze, silver and gold to represent the tiers of fans we have for our teams) dealing damage to each enemy unit they pass through



W - Pick a card: MasterCard Twisted Fate chooses a MasterCard from his deck, and uses for his next attack causing bonus effects.

Credit MasterCard- slows enemies just like it slows the speed of your bank account decreasing.

Debit MasterCard- gives the most damage and refunds mana because reasons.

Savings MasterCard- stuns the enemy hit as they cannot believe the incredible savings rates brought to you by MasterCard.



E - Stacked account: every four attacks, $50 bills will float around MasterCard Twisted Fate and his next attack will throw a big MasterCard at the enemy dealing bonus damage.



R - Destiny - MasterCard Twisted Fate predicts the financial misfortune of his foes, grants true sight and allows him to teleport across the map to give them the incredible good credit only brought to you by MasterCard.



Also this skin will only allow you to run the Acer Predator rune keystone",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0000022487CB0980>

13,9zehpd,I_AM_LoLNewbie,"With Riot's partnership with Mastercard, it would be nice to see a Riot co-branded Mastercard credit card with RP rewards.",2018-11-22 14:23:33+00:00,1499,"Like the title says, I would be interested in a card that offered RP back for purchases. I imagine it would also make sense for both Riot and Mastercard, directly linking the two companies with a product for LoL players.  

It also wouldn't be unprecedented for Riot to issue a co-branded card with rewards for their players. Previously Riot has partnered with Amex to offer the [RP+ American Serve](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/store-update/get-rp-rp-american-express-serve). However the long term RP rewards were lacking as it was a debit card. With the higher interchange fees that credit cards charge, Riot could potentially offer a more lucrative rewards program if they were to release a co-branded credit card.    

A potential rewards program could be something along the lines of 5 RP per dollar spent, with a 25000 RP signup bonus and custom LoL card design.  

I'd like to hear what the community thinks of the idea and if there is support for a LoL credit card. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0000022487EB9DC0>

For background, I’m a journalist in the space, and I write (almost) exclusively about League. I know this is really just a marketing ploy, but honestly it took my breath away a little bit so I wanted to at least share it on here. On the inside was a pamphlet with more info on the partnership, a mouse pad, and a Worlds hat. The box itself though is really the kicker. This definitely made me (more) excited about Worlds and proud to be a part of the game’s ecosystem, and I think it’s well done.
